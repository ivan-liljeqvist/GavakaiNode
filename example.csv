I've been looking for her for years and have yet to find a hint of her online past a news article we both were in from grade 6. I hold on to hope though. I found a friend from grade 2 after searching for 6 years, so I may yet find her.

EDIT: since this is headed to the front page and this comment happens to be near the top and you never know, the internet is magic...

**KATELYN! Yes, you, the one from Colorado and Alaska. Your old friend from Canada is looking for you. Send me a PM!**

EDIT2: Since people keep asking how you go about finding someone and I have had one success at this:  
1. Start with the name. Get the first and last name. Use your yearbook, photos from events/teams, anything from the time you two knew each other. If your friend has a hyphened last name (eg James Smith-Jones) then you're going to look for the hyphened name AND both individual names (eg James Smith-Jones, James Smith, and James Jones). People change their names.  
2. Next: google. Yes, as simple as that. Google your friend and search to the nth page for anything that might be relevant. Add keywords if your friend had some defining characteristic, a physical disability, an obscure injury, some great skill, anything that might pop up.   
3. Social Media. Go to every site that uses ""real names"" (Facebook, G+, and linkedin are good starters) and search for your friend there.  
4. Don't give up hope and keep searching, it could take years before you get lucky, but if you don't give up, eventually you will.  
5. Good Luck.

EDIT3: OMG **I found her!** This post made me try googling again for the first time in quite a while and I found her on Linkedin! I also found her wedding site (people tighten your security on stuff like that seriously!) I've sent her a message and am hoping for the best. I've changed my name since we were kids, so she might ignore my message, but I guess we'll see. Thanks everyone for inspiring me to look one more time!

**EDIT4: AAAHH!!** First off, thanks kind stranger for the reddit gold, it's my first gilding! **She responded to my message**, we're connected on linkedin now and conversating nicely! I'm so excited, it's been over a decade since we last talked! Thanks reddit for being supportive. Have a scroll through the comments to see some other inspiring and amazing stories and maybe see your name listed next to someone who's searching. Reddit is amazing!"

Every few years the ducks show up in stores again (the last time I saw one was around 2008), but I've never been able to learn their origin.  Here's a bit of a back story about this duck (some info I've posted before, some is new):

In 1977, a toy company called Knickerbocker created a new toy called [Ernie's Rubber Duckie](http://i.imgur.com/sFrVREs.jpg).  Designed by famous toy inventor [Henry Orenstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Orenstein) (patent [USD260915](http://www.google.com/patents/USD260915)), this toy would lay the foundation for one of the most iconic rubber ducks in history.  In 1983, Knickerbocker was sold to Hasbro; which produced more of the ducks around 1985 through [Playskool](http://i.imgur.com/I4HZiLq.jpg).  Around that time, a Taiwanese factory got a hold of this toy and started creating [generic knockoffs of it](http://i.imgur.com/F5knoAj.jpg).  By 1992, Playskool discontinued production of their rubber duck, but the Taiwanese factory continued on.  Every few years, this anonymous factory produced replicas which would appear in toy stores across the United States.

Remember [this stock photo](http://i.imgur.com/8CliVBH.jpg)?  It appeared in everything from Photoshop tutorials to the default Windows user account profile picture.  Some were even [used in an experiment to test the pollution caused by different kinds of jet ski engines](http://i.imgur.com/dHJvPYB.jpg).  Those particular ducks are now [mounted on the desk of politician Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif](http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rep-mark-desaulnier-d-calif-keeps-a-bottle-of-california-news-photo/465167140).  The last time I ever saw them was in a World Market around 2008 [(video evidence from 2005)](http://vimeo.com/28158).

If you have one of these, feel free to check the bottom and I guarantee you'll find the ""Made in Taiwan"".  They seem to all come from one source, yet I have never been able to track them down.  My dream is to some day discover where they're made and start my own store for them.

Edit: I want to thank all the people who have tried looking for me!  Unfortunately, the search goes on.  Several people have found very similar ducks, the closest probably being the [Bath and Body Works ducks](https://i.imgur.com/jNU9XUr.jpg) or [this knockoff of the knockoff](http://i.imgur.com/meVvrP1.jpg) which is from China and is significantly lower quality."

For some reason my friend's mom kept renting this movie for her completely unaware it was full of sex and nudity. 

Basically it was a thriller about this guy who was either English or American, I can't remember which, who was visiting France (I think?) and for whatever reason stopped at this one big house and stayed with these strangers for a bit. One of the people in the house was a hot chick and so he banged her and then a day or two later went on his way. 

However, every road he went on away from the house brought him BACK to the house, and every time he got back to the house the people wouldn't remember him. This happened over and over. It was basically like a dramatic European version of groundhog day. 

I've tried seaching for this movie basically since I started using the internet and I have no idea what it was called. I'm starting to think I dreamed the whole thing.

**EDITED TO ADD A FEW MORE DETAILS:** 

* I would have watched this movie around 1994/1995, it wasn't a new release but I don't remember thinking that it seemed like a really old movie, so I'm guessing it was made in the early 90s or 1980s.

* This movie didn't have any sort of amnesia plot. A lot of people have suggested it. I BELIEVE there was some sort of ghost thing that happened (spoiler alert, but it's looking more and more like I imagined this all anyway).   

*  There weren't any major celebrities in it that I can remember. I think it was a European film though so there may have been some European stars in it that' I'm not familiar with.

* I remember it being really long. It was a cool movie but after the 6th or so time of him ending up at this house we were like, ""REALLY?! AGAIN?!"" so it wasn't a TV show. 

* I believe it took place in the past, like the 30s.

I don't remember any more, but I was dissapointed when I bought the book and it was different. The version I read included editors notes and error corrections, and being that it was similar to the published version I suspect it was an early draft.

Everyone else in the channel knew who we were and what was happening and thought it was among the most adorable things they'd ever seen.

I never met her when voice chat was a thing. She only ever sent one picture, too. One day, she disappeared. I spoke with other people on the channel who were close to her who mentioned that she had problems at home. Whatever they were, we never spoke again. This all happened around 13-14 years ago. At least 8 years back, I sent a message out to as many Samantha Andersons as I could find on Facebook in Australia, asking if any had ever gone by ""Lily,"" but it was something of a lost cause.

When I was little, I had this Cinderella book, (not disney) and it came with a cassette so you could listen to the story when you read it. Now, before the actual narration of the story began, there was this song. I LOVE the song. Its SO pretty, and I can't remember much of the lyrics, but I can remember the melody. 

I have googled in every combination of the lyrics I can think of, sung that shit into Soundhound, looked on youtube, tried to find the book itself so I can buy the fucker, but NOTHING will tell me the name of the song, or who sings it. What kills me inside is that a few years ago, I FOUND THE ARTIST, but stupid fucker that I am, I didn't write it down.I have never been able to find it since.

This is as much of the lyrics as I can remember. 

""Once upon a time, when the world was full of magic. Once upon a time when a dream could last forever, (forever). Dragons, lions and dwarfs, witches and wizards too. Beauty's beast and bears ... (Chorus-y bit)... maids to rescue witches to conquer ... Over the rainbow, .... Your dreams will come true.""

Its sung by a woman, and I'm sure the book was published by Parragon, early 2000's (I don't have the book with me to check). I've been on their site and they don't sell it anymore. :(



Ugh, I want to find this SO MUCH. Maybe someone will recognise it???

EDIT: Ok Guys, thanks for all the comments! Here's what I know so far:

The book is in the Treasured Tales series by Parragon Publishing, published some times in the early 2000's. Every book in the series has the song playing before the actual narration begins. Here's the title page I found: [Cinderella](http://ca.pbsstatic.com/l/08/0608/9781405440608.jpg)

I still can't find the name of the song, it's just [listed](http://www.45worlds.com/tape/media/nc214310uk) as opening or closing song.

It's performed by Denica Freeman (87% sure).

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXDQzjpilbs) Youtube video is an actual recording of the series! It's the Three Bears, but the opening notes are there and its the right narrator guy and I was having a heart attack from all the nostalgia, and then the video fucking skipped the song. I'm so pissed.

I'm not sure I'll find an actual recording of it anywhere on the internet :( 

But thanks for all the helpful replies!!!"
44, "What's your internet ""white whale"", something you've been searching for years to find with no luck?", UnBuggsyBaggins, "I just created an account for this.  This may be what I've been waiting for since I began lurking years and years ago.
Here's what I'm looking for. 
Its a stop-motion animation that involves a platform that looks like a chessboard floating in a grey void. 
In the very middle of the chessboard is a treasure chest.  
At each corner of the chessboard and in the middle along each side is an identical figurine.  He looks sort of like Jack Skellington, although his face isn't as featured and he's wearing a nondescript trench coat.  They may have a name tag on the back with a bar code, although my mind might have added that in the years since I've seen it. 

Anyway, the scene starts out with no motion/sound for a very long time.  I remember almost changing the channel.  But then eventually... on of the figures looks left, looks right, then boldly walks towards the chest in the middle.
This upsets the balance on the board and the chest starts sliding.  All the other figures scramble wildly to reestablish equilibrium.  But this one jackass keeps going after the chest.  The chest is sliding around too as the board yaw's and rolls.
Eventually there are casualties as some figures slide off the end of the board and down into the void.  
Some of the other figures begin to start chasing the chest as well (as opposed to simply trying to maintain the balance) and it becomes a sort of battle to get the chest. 
This goes on for a fairly short time (considering how long I waited for something to happen) and in the end, there's one 'victor' who's managed to get all the other figures off the board.  
The problem now is that the board is balanced on a single axis with the 'victor' at one end of the board and the chest at the other.  
If he steps towards the chest, the board will tip and the chest will fall off. 
So he's stuck where he is. 

It's haunted me for a very long time. It seems like I've yet to find a better example of human nature, and why its important for us to work with people rather than against them.

> It's been found that 50% of test takers who retake it score differently the second time.

> It's a fine way to give people a quick snapshot of what their strengths and weaknesses might be, and of those with whom they interact. To get the dialog going, this is a perfectly valid tool. But as a tool for making career decisions, relationship decisions, or psychiatric assessment, no.

> Due to these legitimate criticisms of the MBTI and its unscientific underpinnings, the test is rarely used in clinical psychology. I did a literature search on PubMed and discovered that, interestingly, many of the published studies of its practical utility come from nursing journals. Many of the other publications pertain to relationship counseling and religious counseling. Normally, this is a red flag. When you see a topic that purports to be psychological being used in practically every professional discipline except psychology, you have very good reason to be skeptical of its actual value.

For more, [here's the Skeptoid episode transcript](http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4221). I wrote a paper on personality testing some years ago, and a lot of my findings were echoed by the Skeptoid piece. Just something to keep in mind."

>The first Roman fire brigade of which we have any substantial history was created by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Marcus Licinius Crassus was born into a wealthy Roman family around the year 115 BC, and acquired an enormous fortune through (in the words of Plutarch) ""fire and rapine."" One of his most lucrative schemes took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department. Crassus filled this void by creating his own brigade—500 men strong—which rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the fire fighters did nothing while their employer bargained over the price of their services with the distressed property owner. If Crassus could not negotiate a satisfactory price, his men simply let the structure burn to the ground, after which he offered to purchase it for a fraction of its value. Emperor Nero took the basic idea from Crassus and then built on it to form the Vigiles in AD 60 to combat fires using bucket brigades and pumps, as well as poles, hooks and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force. The later brigades consisted of hundreds of men, all ready for action. When there was a fire, the men would line up to the nearest water source and pass buckets hand in hand to the fire."

It was at this point that I noticed he was actually sweating quite a lot, with probably enough liquid to fill Guantanamo Bay. An older man then yelled out ""Don't worry about Marco, kid. He does this every month or so"". Rubio heard the man, turned to him looking annoyed, and then slowly turned back away. There was something odd about the way he moved though, something sort of robotic. He then looked across to the other side of the library, and sprinted with the books into the young adult fiction section. Once there he began trying to cram the books into the shelves, even where there was little room. It was that day that I first checked out Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal."

It's happened to me in my classes at school, it happened to me at my job where all the other cooks assumed I had no skill because I was a twenty something year old female with my hair and makeup done up. 

They're threatened and scared because society as a whole is realizing that, aside from some strength-based professions/activities/etc (which is all debatable) women really can do anything a man can, and possibly even better.

There are many factors that are looked at when deciding if someone is an employee or an independent contractor.  Primarily they go to whether the person doing the work has independent control over how the work is done.  Think of it as akin to a general contractor hiring out a plumber sub-contractor.  The general contractor will have plans and can be specific about materials and other things concerning what needs to be done.  The general contractor and the plumber will agree on what the cost will be, and they will agree on when the work will be done, but then the plumber will left alone to actually do the work.  The general contractor will inspect and approve the work, but will not be looking over the plumber shoulder directing what the plumber is doing.

I suspect that the team involved here wanted to be specific about what the cheerleaders could and could not do -- how to act, what to look like, etc. . . Certainly the advice manual referenced in the article is over the top.  But, I suspect they want to be in complete control over the image.  Once the hiring person or company starts controlling all sorts of details beyond the basics -- they become much more like an employer rather than someone hiring an independent contractor to do a job.  

My guess is that teams that want cheerleaders on the sideline will either simply add them to the basic payroll -- it's not like it will break them to pay them $20 and hour, pay payroll taxes, etc. . . , or form a company that they will then hire to provide cheerleading services, and that company then will have to follow the employment laws.

We mostly do not like companies to take advantage of people with little negotiating power.  We should like that people want to work and to be part of things like NFL football.  We should not like that when those folks are being told by the team when and what to do that they are not being treated fairly as an employee. 

As an aside -- the amount to be paid is only dictated by minimum wage laws and wage/hour laws.  People can agree to work for the minimum wage, but it has to be paid for all hours actually worked.

Well, there are Muslims redditors, so some folks need to stop pulling bullshit like that.
If it is consensual, Sharia law consider it adultery and it punish with 100 lashes. But if it's not, it's considered rape and it's punished by death. But this ""rape considered adultery"" bullshit is something you need to take somewhere else. And congrats on how you worded to title. A fine piece of art to be added to the anti-islam propaganda gallery.

edit: I made some mistakes. I did some research and I had a couple misconceptions. The punishment for rape is not death. The punishment is 100 lashes and a year of exile for the never-been-married, and stoning for the married or ex-married. Which is the same punishment for adultery, but that still doesn't support ""Rape is adultery"" claim, because there are other key differences. The victim is not punished. The 4 witnesses condition is not applied, it just has to be proven. Some scholars also said he need to pay a fine to the victim (if his punishment is survivable). And one last thing, if the rape was made under the threat of a weapon like a gun or a knife, the punishment is cutting right hand and left leg or vice versa. I found that there are some academic islamic studies on rape. So if I ever educate myself some more and read any of them, I will post updates.

Now since if it's either adultery or rape, the punishment is still death for this mulla, since he's most likely married. I'm not sure what was the defense strategy here. The only thing I can think of is that they wanted to prove it was consensual, so it would be adultery, in that case the 4 witnesses will apply, which will get this mulla off the hook."

> *According to Sharia Law, which the Mullah tried to rely on in court, rape is considered a form of adultery for which both parties are responsible. Amin’s defence lawyers argued that he should be sentenced to 100 lashes and then released – but that would have meant the girl also receiving the same punishment.*

So I turned to more reliable source, and read that the rapist tried to use Afghan's corrupted tribal courts where sometimes (depending on the corruption of the judge) rape is treated as fornication instead of rape, which of course carries a lighter sentence.

This has nothing to do with Sharia, because under Sharia, rape is considered two crimes for the rapist. One crime has to do with fornication and the other has to do with forcing the victim. 

Here's what an actual jurist of sharia states:

> “*If a woman is raped, she should press charges against the one who raped her. If it is proved that she was raped, then the court must apply discretionary punishment or ta`zir on the rapist. Such discretionary punishment may reach the death penalty, according to some schools of thought. This is based wholly on the fact that the rape is confirmed through medical tests and court procedures, without the confession of the rapist himself*....**As for the rape victim, no punishment is to be inflicted on her. She is to be treated with dignity and honor, and all forms of help should be given to her to gain her rights**.”

~ Dr. A.Y. Sulaiman, Prof. of  Law & Sharia at Cairo Uni.

p.s. I think what's almost as bad as the rape itself is any culture that convinces the rape victim to feel ashamed for the crime against her (or him, coz men get raped too). Some righteous Muslim scholars took the following position that's sorely needed:

> Kamal Badr: **“The society also has a role to play in rehabilitating the rape victim. Instead of deserting her or considering her a person non grata in the society, for the crime she has no hand in, Islam calls upon the society to rush to assist her in modifying and improving her life. We should show her the way out the pain of abuse. Thus, many Muslim scholars, led by Sheikh Al-Qaradawi, have maintained that young Muslim men should hasten to marry women who fall as rape victims, so as to reduce their suffering and console them…”**"

They went to the extreme to get their message heard. And they are utter fools because Mr. Sanders gave them the perfect response. 

In closing, Mr. Sanders is held in high regard by a wide segment of the population. We're here for his message.

Don't let the message be taken off course! 

Bernie 2016!"

905, "Bernie just tweeted a link to his Racial Justice plan of action. Let's retweet to increase its visibility.", mintchocochips, "i really really like bernie sanders so far but I just control+f'ed ""asian"" on the page. no results. but control+f ""black"" and ""latino"" and there is. I know some of you guys are really big supporters of Bernie and like what he has to say (I just found out more about him recently but I do like what I've seen so far).

I wouldn't be surprised if the issues that we Asians face aren't that well understood by him (not many famous ppl/politicians do), or even if any of those issues can be solved by politics at all. But can someone please give me some info or anything to show that he does care? He's been a senator for so long. Maybe at one point in time, he's said one thing. That would be enough for me to be happy about this.

If not, that's cool. None of the other candidates have said anything about Asian Americans either (or ever do). We're used to fighting our battles alone and can be patient for the opportunities for change that we know will come one day.

edit: I also understand that there's probably not many Asians where he's from. But he's going to be president of all of us and we are a group that, despite not having shared origins, have shared struggles in America. What can I bring home to tell my family and friends?"

"
932, "Exactly, Jon. Exactly.", Rookwood, "It's not even that.  People here are defending Jon for not covering him because he's a satirist and Bernie is not enough of a character to make it worth his time.  

The truth is, however, that this is the premise the entire American media operates on as well.  Our entire political system is satire, and Bernie isn't following the script.  He doesn't fit into the narrative of Republicans vs. Democrats, liberals vs. neo-liberals, people who speak loudly but say nothing.  People who speak to emotions not reason.  No, he's up there talking about real change.  Turning the bus around so to speak, and taking America in an entirely different direction than it's been going for the last 60 years.

No one wants that.   The money and power says we are going in one direction and it's already been decided.  The rest is just theater and you better know your role or else no one in the media is going to give you the time of day. "

     The republican debate on Thursday broke Fox News viewership records with 24 million viewers, and that was with the cable subscription paywall they put it behind. 

     If the democratic debates get anywhere near that viewership (which they will because they will be more accessible for average Americans via live streams etc.) and if Bernie speaks half as well as the dozens of interviews and speeches I've watched him make, then Bernie WILL start a fucking political revolution.

Lots of parallels between Sanders and Corbyn -- both are politicians on the far left of their party who served for decades in legislature before finally running for leader. Both are traveling around the country drawing huge crowds at rallies that their rivals can't come close to matching.

[Before their first poll in March](https://www.franklinpierce.edu/institutes/mfcc/polling.htm#results), Franklin Pierce had not released any polls in six years.

Open Debates is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that works to reform the presidential debates. Currently, as many of you may be aware, the presidential debates are largely controlled by the Republican and Democratic parties, through a private corporation called the Commission on Presidential Debates. Their name makes them seem non-partisan and official, but they are far from it. As a result, challenging formats and popular independent candidates are often excluded from the debates, and fewer debates are held, or negotiated to be eliminated entirely. George Farah goes into some amazing (and shocking) history about the evolution of the debates, and the entire 25+minutes of the podcast is well worth your time.

Open Debates is engaged in a campaign to inform the public, the news media and policy makers about the antidemocratic conduct of the Commission on Presidential Debates. Open Debates is also promoting the creation of an alternative presidential debate sponsor comprised of national civic leaders who are committed to maximizing voter education.

* So I had to fuck him calm, & then I left. Now when I got in the car it was a white boy (her bt) & this hulking black guy (NOT the same one)

So we leave and head to Jarrett & the raggedy motel. Cus our shit was there. As we pull up, Jarrett chillin outside smokin weed wit some dude. PAY ATTENTION HERE! We get out and walk up to them and Jarrett goes ""here they go."" The pimp goes ""HERE GO WHO LIL NIGGA, WHO DIS?!"" Jarrett starts laughing and was like ""he was asking me who I was here wit & I said my girl and her friends and that's all. Chill out."" The guy Jarrett was talkin to laughs & goes ""I'll catch u later man. Nice meeting u."" and leaves. He was a black guy wit dreads. A FL nigga. 

So we all go up to the room and the pimp is going OFF on Jarrett. ""U don't know these niggas!! I can't believe u told him 2 bitches in here!!"" And Jarrett goes ""he asked why I was out here mad last night. All I said was my girl went to work wit her friend and I ain't want her to!"" Now the pimp SCREAMING ""SO THAT NIGGA KNO IT'S MONEY UP HERE NOW?! HELL NO. WE GOTTA GO!! NOW."" Me and Jess are like 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳"

Don't just 'move on'. Break off all contact. Don't follow them on social media, don't go to places you know she frequents in hopes you'll catch a glimpse of her. Don't think about her until you even forget her name. If you see her on the street just be like ""oh, hey' and keep walking. Excising the emotion and the obsession is the only way to maintain your sanity and dignity. Reserve that enthusiasm only for women who are truly interested in and excited about you as you are for them.

He'd meet a gang of rough and tumble birds who he would impress using his human knowledge, like where do find the best breadcrumbs, etc, and in return they teach him the value of family and teamwork. Eventually he learns a life lesson or something and turns back into a human, but his heart is soaring through the skies with his bird family.

The last scene in the movie is him sitting on a park bench throwing breadcrumbs, watching his daughter on the playground. The camera zooms in slowly on his face and we see that something profound has changed in him, and right before the scene cuts to black, a dollop of bird poop lands right on his shoulder.

Plus knowing the train is taking it somewhere it wants to go, it's probably not just hopping on because it doesn't know any better and taking an unknown adventure like some drunk dude.

Take a look at his hand on the microphone, the speed at which he falls, and the placement of the body in relation to the microphone stand. Also, note the slight wobble of the microphone stand itself when it is not being touched. The falling kid also does not cast a shadow on the drum equipment at all and is inconsistent with the lighting in the room (you can see shadows on the walls of the drum equipment).

The kid on the drum kit doesn't react at all for a reason.

EDIT: It has been pointed out by another redditor that he/she has seen this on AFV. Potentially the video seems fake to me because the camcorders at the time could not capture all of the frames of the kid falling and makes it look edited.

She told me a similar story about gorillas that she worked with.  One young male in particular.  A piece of trim around on of the windows in the enclosure had been pried up and was missing.  Most of the gorillas knew some basic sign, and the handlers make the sign to trade.  They indicated that they would trade grapes, a favorite food of that group for any of the window strip material.  At least one young male gorilla repeatedly brought small six inch or less pieces to trade.  The handlers eventually determined that he had a very large piece and was breaking it into small parts to trade for a net gain in grape goodness."

Some time into this routine, he would check his line to find the bait missing, but no fish. It happened enough for him to wonder what was happening to his fishing line.

He set bait on his line, and then watched it. During the night, a raven landed by the fishing hole. With its beak, it pulled the line, with it's foot, it held the line down, and repeat. The raven did this for the length of the line, and grabbed the fish from the end. It let loose and the line sunk back underwater. Then flew away with its bounty.

I, personally, have spent a lot of time around ravens and they did get to know my schedule. I think they could recognize my truck, which was a pickup used to haul trash to a burn box. They followed me, cleaned up my dumping area. When I had to empty my burn box, they would sit in the treetops and wait for me to finish so they could pick out the warm food scraps.

To clarify, I spend a good amount of free time researching this topic, as opposed to just watching Blackfish and forming an opinion from that.

Firstly, SeaWorld is primarily an entertainment facility. That's why it's called ""SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment"", not ""SeaWorld Rescue & Rehab"". They make more than enough money to focus on rescue & rehab work, but they choose not to. Not only do they make enough profit themselves for it, but they receive government grants as well for it. So, in short - they're rolling in the $$$ for rescue work.

Obviously I'm not against the rescue work, that's all well and good. It's the fact that they don't retire the orcas and they breed them over and over until they can't breed anymore (see: Gudrun, Corky II cases). The life-spans barely touch wild life-spans and only 2 male orcas have lived up to the wild average currently (Tilikum, Ulises). How does this happen with their ""superior veterinary care""? Why are their teeth being drilled out until they're just left with gums if they have such ""high standard dental care""? 

Idk how many people have heard about the ""Blue World Project"" where they're planning on upgrading the orca tanks so they're bigger and less barren. But they've lied outright to the public there since they still don't have planning permission for that, despite saying building work would start by now!

It's not just SeaWorld itself - it's the support they give to other substandard facilities that own cetaceans too. They sent **three young, related killer whales over to Spain on a BREEDING LOAN**. That is the height of irresponsibility! The orcas have a shitty fucked up social structure because they never learned how to live together so they're always fighting and two inbred calves have been born there that the mother rejected and one died in 2013. Not only that, but the facility itself is crap; the orcas eat the paint off the walls because the park own couldn't be arsed to wait longer to fix it which means endoscope procedures for the orcas which is dangerous for the orcas and trainers involved. If SeaWorld really gives a fuck about their orcas, why are they letting this happen?? I'm not on about the trainers - I get that they must care about the animals they work with - I mean the higher-ups making these decisions.

They also support Mundo Marino since they can't breed from Tilikum anymore (since he's overrepresented in the population) so they buy sperm from their orca, Kshamenk. Look him up and you'll see the issue there.

I could bang on all day about this but yeah. 

tl;dr SeaWorld rescue & rehab is great, good job guys. But they seriously need to make some huge changes concerning the orcas because they dun fucked up there a lot.

You may think. ""Because of magma"" or even smarter ""because it is hot"" or dangerous gasses aspixiate you. 

nope. It is even more deadly than that. 

A boat works off displacing water and it floats on top of the water because the hull is big enough to push down on the water to keep it a float. That is how a big METAL cruise ship works. 

put a cup in a tub of water. .. push down.. feel that resistance.. 

GOOD.. now you know how a boat works.

>Lowered water density

>Submarine volcanoes release large quantities of gas bubbles into the water, even in quiet times between eruptions. This can lower the density of the seawater above the vent. This is very dangerous to shipping, because boats entering a zone of lowered water density will lose buoyancy and may sink.

Few seconds later it sounded like someone with a sledgehammer was pounding on that tower and it lasted for about 30 seconds or so.  They could hear debris hitting other equipment.  People found concrete/rebar chunks the size of softballs around there although much of it smaller.  Lots of dented cars and broken glass.  He took us to the explosion site about a week later and there were chunks of concrete the size of cars 2 blocks away.  They block I saw had hit the street, and bounced.  It left a crater/trench at least 5 feet deep.  One of the offices nearby had a metal chunk go through their wall and take out a filing cabinet."

Whenever I teach AI, Machine Learning, or Intelligent Robotics, my class and I end up having what I call ""The Terminator Conversation.""  My point in this conversation is that the dangers from AI are overblown by media and non-understanding news, and the real danger is the same danger in any complex, less-than-fully-understood code: edge case unpredictability.  In my opinion, this is different from ""dangerous AI"" as most people perceive it, in that the software has no motives, no sentience, and no evil morality, and is merely (ruthlessly) trying to optimize a function that we ourselves wrote and designed.  Your viewpoints (and Elon Musk's) are often presented by the media as a belief in ""evil AI,"" though of course that's not what your signed letter says.  Students that are aware of these reports challenge my view, and we always end up having a pretty enjoyable conversation.

First off I just wanted to say thank you for inspiring me (and many others I'm sure) to take physics through to university. When I was a teenager planning what to study at university, my mother bought me a signed copy of your revised version of “A Brief History of Time” with your (printed) signature, and Leonard Mlodinow’s personalised one. It is to this day still one of my most prized possessions, which pushed me towards physics - although I went down the nuclear path in the end, astronomy and cosmology still holds a deep personal interest to me!

My actual question is regarding black holes. As most people are aware, once something has fallen into a black hole, it cannot be observed or interacted with again from the outside, but the information does still exist in the form of mass, charge and angular momentum. However scientific consensus now holds that black holes “evaporate” over time due to radiation mechanisms that you proposed back in the 70s, meaning that the information contained within a black hole could be argued to have disappeared, leading to the black hole information paradox. 

I was wondering what you think happens to this information once a black hole evaporates? I know that some physicists argue that the holographic principle explains how information is not lost, but unfortunately string theory is not an area of physics that I am well versed in and would appreciate your insight regarding possible explanations to this paradox!"

A common method for teaching a machine is to feed the it large amounts of problems or situations along with a “correct“ result.  However, most human behavior cannot be classified as correct or incorrect.  If we aim to create an artificially intelligent machine, should we filter the behavioral inputs to what we believe to be ideal, or should we give the machines the opportunity to learn unfiltered human behavior?

If we choose to filter the input in an attempt to prevent adverse behavior, do we not also run the risk of preventing the development of compassion and other similar human qualities that keep us from making decisions based purely on statistics and logic?

For example, if we have an unsustainable population of wildlife, we kill some of the wildlife by traps, poisons, or hunting, but if we have an unsustainable population of humans, we would not simply kill a lot of humans, even though that might seem like the simpler solution."

My name is Zoe and I am a sixteen year old living in Los Angeles.  I am a long time Girl Scout (11 years) and am now venturing forth unto my Gold Award.  The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest award in girl scouting, it is equivalent to the Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts.  It teaches a lot of life skills with research, paperwork and interviews, but also with hosting workshops and reaching out to people. The project requires at least 80 hours of work, which I find less daunting then making the project leave a lasting affect (which is the other big requirement of the project).  To do that, I am creating a website that will be  a lasting resource for years to come.

For my project, I am raising awareness about AAC (Alternative Augmented Communication) devices.  Even though I am not an AAC user, I have see the way that they can help someone who is nonverbal through the experience of my best friend since elementary school.  I want to thank you for your help already with my project, by just being such a public figure that you are, I can say. ""An AAC device is a computer that someone uses when they are nonverbal (gets blank stares), you know like Professor Hawking's computer (then they all get it)""  

I have already presented at California State University Northridge and held a public workshop to raise awareness for AAC devices.  For my presentation, I explained what AAC devices are and how they new an option for people who are nonverbal.  They are such a new option, that many people do not know they exist.  As soon as my best friend knew that she could get an AAC device, she got one and it helped her innumerably.  Before she had it, all she had to communicate was yes and no, but when she got her device, there were so many more things for her to say.  One instance, where she was truly able to communicate was when we were working on our science fair project.  We had been researching the effects that different types of toilet paper had on the environment, and I had proposed that we write our data on a roll of toilet paper (clean), to make it creative and interesting when we had to present it to the class.  Before, she would have just said no to the idea if she did not like it, but we would not know why, but with her AAC device, she was able to be an active part of the project by saying no and explaining why, she said ""it was gross"".  That is true communication at it's finest and I have heard of other similar instances like this.  

But my project is not only for the potential AAC users, I am also aiming my project toward everyone else.  I want to get rid of some of the social awkwardness that comes with using an AAC device.  It is not that people are rude on purpose, they just do not know how to interact.  One instance of this that really stood out to me had to do with the movie ""The Theory of Everything.""  I was reading an interview with Eddie Redmayne about how he got to meet you, in the interview he said that he had researched all about you and knew that you use an AAC device, but when he finally got to meet you, he did not know how to act and kept talking while you were trying to answer.  This awkwardness was not on purpose, but awareness and education on how to interact with AAC users, would help fix this situation.  My best friend also had problems with this same issue when she went to a new school. I addressed this with my project by holding a public workshop where AAC users and non AAC users came and learned about AAC devices.  They made their own low technology AAC boards and had to use them for the rest of the workshop to communicate. We also had high technology AAC devices for them to explore and learn about.  The non AAC user participants and were able to meet real AAC users.  To me, AAC is meant to break the barrier of communication, not put up new walls because of people's ignorance of the devices.

To quote The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, ""My thoughts are stars, that can not be fathomed into constellations"". with an AAC Device, we were able to see just a few of those stars, and with more practice we will be able to see constellations.  With more wide spread use and knowledge of AAC devices this can happen for more people.  Thank your for taking to the time to answer everyone's questions - here are my questions for you:

1. In what ways would you like to see AAC devices progress?

2. As a user of an AAC device, what do you see as your biggest obstacle in communicating with non AAC users?

3. What voice do you think in - your original voice or your AAC voice?

4. What is one thing that everybody should know about AAC devices?

5. What advice would you give to non AAC users talking to an AAC user?


Thank you!
Zoe

Your fear of AI appears to stem from the assumption that AI will act like a new biological species competing for the same resources or otherwise transforming the planet in ways incompatible with human (or other) life.

Essentially, biological organisms are optimized to 'take over' as much as they can. It's basically their 'purpose'. But I don't think this is necessarily true of an AI.

I am interested in what you think an AI would be 'interested' in doing, and why that is necessarily a threat to humankind that outweighs the benefits of creating a sort of benevolent God."

When we think about the multiverse theory, it is very likely that our Universe is part of 'anything else', isn’t it? I mean planets are part of solar systems. Solar systems are part of galaxies. Galaxies are part of the universe. So, my questions are:

* What do you think about the multiverse theory?
* If you believe it is likely, how do you think does this 'row' end? Are multiverses part of other multiverses?
* What do you think, how did this all begin? And how will it end?

It blows my mind when I think about that there could have been billion of other universes before our universe even existed. I mean, there could have been million of civilizations which already reached their final phase and died. Compared to this we are just at the very beginning, aren’t we? How likely do you think is that whole theory?

Thank you very much again, Mr. Hawking. 

*Edit - Just for clarification: I'm referring to the ""multiverse theory"" which says that ""our"" universe is a part of a bigger ""something"". (Not the multiverse where you're a rock star or anything like that)  At least for me, this is absolutely likely because it all starts with planets which are part of solar systems, which are part of galaxies, which are part of the universe. Why should this ""row"" end at this place?*"

Earlier this year you, Elon Musk, and many other prominent science figures signed an [open letter](http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter) warning the society about the potential pitfalls of Artificial Intelligence. The letter stated: “We recommend expanded research aimed at ensuring that increasingly capable AI systems are robust and beneficial: our AI systems must do what we want them to do.” While being a seemingly reasonable expectation, this statement serves as a start point for the debate around the possibility of Artificial Intelligence ever surpassing the human race in intelligence.

My questions:

1. One might think it impossible for a creature to ever acquire a higher intelligence than its creator. Do you agree? If yes, then how do you think artificial intelligence can ever pose a threat to the human race (their creators)?

2. If it was possible for artificial intelligence to surpass humans in intelligence, where would you define the line of “It’s enough”? In other words, how smart do you think the human race can make AI, while ensuring that it doesn’t surpass them in intelligence?"

My question is this: How much of your fear of the potential dangers of A.I. is based around the writing of noted futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil?


I just recently finished my Bachelor project on the validity of his [Law of Accelerating Returns (LOAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change#Kurzweil.27s_The_Law_of_Accelerating_Returns), as it has not been peer reviewed but is still highly respected. I found a number of large problems with both the empiric data it was based on as well as its theoretical basis.

LOAR is meant to show the unstoppable accelerating force that drives development of technology to greater and greater heights. As a basis of this, Kurzweil uses his observation that the continued [exponential growth in calculating power of computers](http://www.singularity.com/images/charts/MooresLaw.jpg). Even when the technology they were using were nearing the end of its life cycle and could no longer keep up, another technology simply replaced it with no major breaks in the graph. He then goes on to generalize this to be the case for all technology, even though the only other graph that shows a similar trend across different technologies is [this one on RAM](http://www.singularity.com/images/charts/ram.jpg).

The biggest problem with this is that Kurzweil makes the mistake of believing that when each technology was beginning to have problems continuously experiencing growth, the appearance of a solution in the form of a replacement technology was inevitable. He then goes on to assume that this will always continue to happen. This is called retrospective determinism and is a logical fallacy.

Kurzweil also repeatedly states that no external force, such as politics, economy, lack of resources, technological lock-in or social circumstances can have any major effect on the continued exponential growth of technology. This is very clear technological determinism, which is also problematic, as it keeps Kurzweil from being critical of his own theory.

The reason Kurzweil gives for the continued growth, despite external forces, is (at least in some of his books and essays) that technology is actually a continuation evolution, and is therefore a fundamental aspect of the universe: a natural law. This ignores that all natural examples of exponential growth experiences diminishing returns as necessary resources become scarce. It also displays a fundamental misunderstanding of how evolution works. Kurzweil implies that technological growth is a direct continuation of human evolutionary growth. With this he is hinting that human evolution is working towards a future change. Evolution is however not a sentient, and is as such not working *towards* any specific end-goals, [unlike Kurzweil](http://www.singularity.com/images/charts/CountdowntoSingularityLog.jpg).

Much of the empirical data is based around single sources, often websites that no longer exist. As his books have no methodology sections, the validity of the sources or how they are used is never discussed, leaving open questions of how you get a number for [calculations per second per $1000](http://www.singularity.com/charts/page70.html) for something that was never built like the Charles Babbage Analytical Engine.

In general, Kurzweils writing on the future has the effect of readers that when it touches upon their area of expertise it is obviously completely wrong, but the rest seems quite reasonable. I, myself am not an expert in artifical intelligence research, but Kurzweil is, so I could not hope to know whether his writing on that subject is more valid than his books on the singularity, but I assume so. Just be aware that years of living from innovation might have made Kurzweil too uncritical of his own theories."

Dr. Hawking, do you believe that artificial intelligence could render capitalism an ineffective economic system for humans?  Any person whose form of income is wage income, or Being paid for providing service or work, mainly maintains power in the capitalist system though their ability to work.  If computers replace even 50% of workers who work for a wage, it seems like you would have masses of essentially economically 'useless' humans who would not have the power to procure things in a capitalist system."

What specifically makes you doubt that benevolence is an emergent property of intelligence?

Context:
I have recently presented my [paper discussing friendly AI theory](http://agi-conf.org/2015/workshops/workshop-on-socioeconomic-implications-of-agi/) at the [AGI-2015 conference in Berlin](http://agi-conf.org/2015/) ([proof](http://rationalmorality.info/?p=621)), the only major conference series devoted wholly and specifically to the creation of AI systems possessing general intelligence at the human level and ultimately beyond. The paper’s abstract reads as following:

> “The matter of friendly AI theory has so far almost exclusively been examined from a perspective of careful design while emergent phenomena in super intelligent machines have been interpreted as either harmful or outright dystopian. The argument developed in this paper highlights that the concept of ‘friendly AI’ is either a tautology or an oxymoron depending on whether one assumes a morally real universe or not. Assuming the former, more intelligent agents would by definition be more ethical since they would ever more deeply uncover ethical truths through reason and act in accordance with them while assuming the latter, reasoning about matters of right and wrong would be impossible since the very foundation of morality and therefore AI friendliness would be illogical. Based on evolutionary philosophy, this paper develops an in depth argument that supports the moral realist perspective and not only demonstrates its application to friendly AI theory – irrespective of an AI’s original utility function – making AGI inherently safe, but also its suitability as a foundation for a transhuman philosophy.”

The only reason to worry about transhumanly intelligent machines would be if one believed that matters of right and wrong are arbitrary constructs. A position very popular in post modern academic circles. Holding such a believe however would make advocating for one particular moral stance over another fundamentally untenable as one would have no rational ground to stand on from which to reason from in its favor.

In recent interviews you’ve reiterated how you believe the implications of Artificial Intelligence could spell disaster for the human race. Surely once AI is created, it will advance at an ever-increasing rate; exceeding anything we could ever imagine. There are others however, such as Kevin Kelly or Eric Davis, who believe that technology has a way of merging with evolution, and eventually we might transcend our own biology and consciousness using AI as a platform.  Futurists like Ray Kurzweil see these things becoming a reality as soon as 2045, with the current state of Moore’s Law and the exponential rate of information technology.

I shared your concern until recently when I heard another AI researcher explain how it's irrational.

Specifically, the argument was that there's no reason to be tied to our human form.  Instead we should see AI as the next stage in humanity - a collective technological offspring so to speak.  Whether our biological offspring or technological offspring go on, should not matter to us.

Indeed, worrying about AI replacing us is analogous (albeit to a lesser extent) to worries about genetic engineering or bionic organ replacement.  Many people have made the argument that 'playing God' in these respects is unnatural and should not be allowed and this feels like an extension of that.

Some of my colleagues have published a few papers showing that humans trust technology more when it's anthropomorphized or that we see things as unnatural as immoral. The worry about AI seems to be a product of this innate tendency to fear things that aren't natural. 

Ultimately, I'm wondering what you're thoughts are about this?  Are we simply being irrationally tied to our human form? Or is there a specific reason why AI replacing us would be detrimental (unless you are also predicting a 'terminator' style genocide)"

Bostrom's fantastic work 'Superintelligence' outlined much of the risk which AI poses for me. Yet most people I know, would not want to read this kind of work. Its long and wordy, having terms like 'Existential risk' to define the kind of risk AI poses. 

In short, I'm finding not many people care about the risk of AI at this moment in time. They think of the film Terminator and that's as far as their imagination goes. 

So my question is: **How do you think the risks which AI pose can 'better' presented to the wider public in order to make people aware of the threat?**

Also **what have you personally seen AI do which has made you so worried?** It's great that figures like you and Musk have come out with warnings on AI, but it did make me wonder why you all did it around the same time. I'm just curious as to what you've personally seen AI do so far that has provoked this wave of warnings.

I am chinese,so pardon my English,I had series thoughts about future.because my English is poor,so I make my comment simple and direct.

1.the answer of a classic question ""who am I"" is our memory,what memory in my brain decide who I am.

2.the life for us is sense.I feel I am alive then I am alive.if not,this kind of life is nosense to us.refer to vegetative state.

3.if there is an operation can read my memory out and write into a new body's brain.what would happen? ""I feel I am still alive,just change a body"" do you think this make sense?

4.what about original me thinking,he(original me)don't mind,because he is dead.this world has nothing to him.what about new me(I'd like call it as TA,chinese spelling,means she,he ,it) thinking?TA just feel like making a sleep and live again.but body changed,a new healthy body.and TA must think TA is me.because just my memory in TA's brain.

5.what about the ethics?we can't ignore the human's desire of life.we will make the ethics fit our desire.it always do.

6.what body can we choose?at least we can use the body made by our own sperm and egg.

7.so if the read&write brain machine appeared,we can use it to make our live continue to forever.and if it is prohibited by the society,there must be someone do this privately.no one can prevent human trying to be immortal.

8.if AI is enough to run our memory just like our brain.so the problem of ethics is solved.we can ""live ""in the AI's body.

9:all what I said just a part of our future,you can follow these clues to figer out more questions about universe and life.such as Fermi Paradox.or I would like talk more to you if you have interesting.

10:**if we calculate our civilization's period from the word appearance,and then we ""disappeared"" in thousand years(we invent read&write brain machine),then the whole human's civilization period just within ten thousand years.so what about prehistory civilization of other creature made on the earth?**

11.**There is no exception we all use the first person view to feel our life,and use the third person view to observe the universe.so when we study the universe,the proper way to use is objective(science),but when we want to understand our life,we shoule use the way of subjective ,that means our feeling.otherwise,we should never know the essence of our life.we should take our subjective as objective to research  what the life is for us**

12.**The recipe of life is:who am I(memory in my brain)+where am I(first person view)+consciousness(any creature's body has it,we can choose the fittest one)=I am alive**

13.**If I put my memory into AI,then I(who I am) can get the AI's first person view and consciousness.so I am the terminator,this terminator think TA is me definitely.so don't worry about the AI has its own consciousness.it is a new way in the future for human being.**

14.**about death,you know you are alive but you don't know you are died.just like you know you are awake,but you don't know you are asleep.""are you sleeping?""""yeah,I am""""you lie to me""**

15.**because of no one know he has already died(refer to above),so the feeling of ""the special sleep""is you think nothing else but you still live just change a new body after that read&write memory operation.and  maybe this sleeping can over a few decades even more.**

ps:I decide if have TA'S(new me) existing and TA feel that am I still alive.so do I wanna to become TA before my death.the answer is ""YES"".because I have fear nothing before death and I am very like to try this ""special sleep"".why not

Professor Hawking:

I would never claim to be as ill as you are, but I've been suffering from a medical condition of my own that has crippled me and left me housebound. There's a host of symptoms, but the most severe one has been near-constant excruciating pain. It started off feeling exactly like the kidney stones that started this whole mess (autoimmune reaction ... or something -- doctors have no clue what's going on) and has only gotten worse from there. First I couldn't skate anymore, then I couldn't run, and now I can barely walk. I can't even go to the grocery store anymore. Worse, I feel like the pain has started chipping away at my sanity. I can't remember things anymore. I can't pay attention to anything for more than two minutes or so. I can't even read books because by the time I get to chapter 2 I've forgotten what was in chapter 1. Needless to say, I gone from being a straight-A student to failing 10th grade (though I suppose it doesn't really count as failing if you only attend for a quarter of the year) and am now in the process of failing 11th, too. It's been a constant battle to get the doctors to recognize and treat my illness, and I have been constantly been accused of seeking drugs or having Munchausens. I'm hoping that the new doctors I'm going to see will give me proper pain medication and that treating the pain will make it possible for me to think again, but in the meantime I'm wondering what sort of coping strategies you have. How do you keep your mind sharp even when almost completely paralyzed? How do you keep the stress from breaking you down? It's a very different situation, I know, but I feel like you might be able to give me some advice nonetheless. Thank you for reading this, even if you never respond, and I'm sorry for bringing up such a painful topic."

Do you remember me?
You were in San Francisco in 2005 and had two engagements in Seattle the next day, one of which was presenting your paper describing nothing being able to escape a black hole to the[ Science Fiction Museum] (http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/hawking-cancels-tonights-appearance-at-museum/) (I can't recall the other)  and you became too ill to travel there.  In the course of my job I was sent to your hotel and streamed you live to the venue.  I got to ask you a quantum physics question and you took the time to answer me.  This was one of the greatest moments of my life.
As an aside, you were unable to attend, but I also had the opportunity to be of service to you for your [70th birthday celebration](http://www.ctc.cam.ac.uk/hawking70/) at Cambridge with streaming video.  There were wonderful lectures about your work which I was pushing the buttons that meant you were able to watch the event live.  It was so very very awesome.

Regarding black holes... It is generally accepted that as matter (or you and I on our spaceship) approaches a black hole, time dilation and spaghettification takes place, and that it is a generally unpleasant and violent experience. It makes sense to me that upon approaching a massive body like a star or gas giant, that destruction would be something perceived and experienced by the matter/people approaching, as the object and its gravitational pull and pressure are an ""understandable"" force, and time dilation would not slow to the point it would near a singularity. What I find difficult to wrap my head around is how we, if we were to approach an event horizon, would perceive these events, or if we ever would at all. All objects of mass create a ""dip"" in the fabric of space-time, though in the case of a black hole it is my understanding that the fabric of space-time is being warped and stretched to a point that is hardly conceivable (for me, anyway), the singularity being ""infinitely"" massive. Assuming, miraculously, there was no other matter immediately adjacent and jostling us for position (which would of course result in our destruction) would we on our approach even perceive this stretching and change in timeflow? To the outside, I would assume it would look like a very quick and violent demise, but I wonder that to the person going for the ride, so to speak, it would simply be a never-ending trip to oblivion.

A less rambling version: when approaching a black hole, considering the bizarre effects on time and space, would one be able to perceive the change in time flow and the stretching of space-time around them as they themselves are in it? Could spaghettification take place without the person even realizing they are being spaghettified?

If that even is a possibility, as a follow-up, is it possible that objects, as they approach very near or actually enter the singularity, could continue on as though nothing has happened, since again, it is the space itself that has been bent and ""pulled out from underneath us?"" Or have I been relying too heavily on an analogy of objects making fabric imprints?"
1804, "Researchers have developed a blood test that can accurately diagnose, from a single drop of blood, if a person has cancer, with 96% certainty for most cancer types", Voerendaalse, "> Subsequent validation using a separate validation cohort (n = 108), not involved in input gene list selection and training of the algorithm, yielded a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 94%, and an accuracy of 96% 

So if you test a 1000 people of say 40 years old, and 20 of them actually have an as of yet undiscovered cancer, with a sensitivity of 97% you are probably going to find all 20; maybe you'll miss one or two. However, with a specificity of 94%, you're also going to find 58 false-positives. 

(Specificity=true negatives/(true negative + false positives) )

So that is well ... reasonable. You'll scare those 58 people, but you may be able to cure some of those 20 (not all, some will unfortunately die of cancer anyway). This also assumes you actually have a 2% cancer rate in the population that you are testing. The lower the actual percentage of people with cancer, the higher the chance that what you find is a false positive. Still, it can become an easy test, and maybe it's worth it to continue testing on say five people to find cancer in one of them. "

The reason is the prevalence rate of various cancers. When you read the paper, which is open access, you find (in Figure 4) that the false positive rate (telling someone that they have cancer, when they don't) was 3% in lung cancer, 4% in brain cancer, and 4% in liver cancer. (The false negative rate, telling someone they're fine when they actually have cancer, was 2%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.

That may sound pretty good. But you have to look at the prevalence rates of these cancers - how many people actually have them. The NIH estimates that there were about 409,000 people living with lung cancer in 2010, for example (http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/lungb.html) out of a total adult population of 241 million. That's a prevalence rate of 0.17%.  So if you test 100,000 adults, you'd expect roughly 170 of them to actually have lung cancer. But this test will tell 3,000 of them who don't have cancer that they do - in other words, you've overdiagnosed lung cancer by a factor of more than 17 times over the real rate. That's completely unacceptable. Meanwhile, of those 170 or so that really did have cancer, you've told three or four of them that they're actually fine. And that's not good, but it pales in comparison to the false positive problem.

You can see that if you require all 100,000 to take the test again, things just get more confusing. Now there are another 3,000 or so false positives, and all you've done is make the signal/noise even worse. That would be a very bad idea, so what if you just take everyone who tested positive and have them do a retake? The 3,000 of those who tested (falsely) positive will give you about 90 false positives again. So now you have 2,910 people from this group who have one up, one down on their two tests, and you have ninety people who still don't have lung cancer, but who have been told twice in a row now that they do.

Keep in mind that there are really only about 170 people who actually do have lung cancer. The 167 of them who really did get a positive diagnosis are going to get tested again, too, if we're retesting everyone who came up positive the first time (we don't know who's a false positive and who's a real one). Of those X, we're going to tell three of them (this time) that they don't actually have cancer (that 2% false negative rate). The others are now in the two-positive-test camp, so the total breakdown is this after one round of testing, and another round for those who tested positive:

100,000 people tested.
164 who really have cancer and who learned about it from this test, and have tested positive twice in a row.
90 people who don't have cancer at all but who have also tested positive twice in a row.
2,913 who have had one positive test and one negative one, and who have no idea what to do next
3 who really have cancer, but have been told that they're fine.

Note that this means that if you test positive twice in a row, it means that your odds of actually having lung cancer are still only 65% (164  of the twice-in-a-rows really do, 90 don't). You wouldn't imagine that this would be possible, running a 96% accurate test twice in a row, but that's exactly how it works.

And lung cancer has a reasonably high prevalence rate. For the cancers with fewer people out in the population, the numbers can be much worse (depending on the false positive rate, but that seems to be around 3 or 4 % in general). In general, a test like this has a possibility of being useful - in a sense of sending people to do some other sort of test, if there is one. But for lung cancer, that might well be an X-ray, and we've now irradiated thousands of people who didn't need to be. 

A good diagnostic test for cancer is an excellent thing, perhaps the best thing we've got to fight the disease. But they're hard to find, and we don't have nearly enough of them."

Basically they took blood samples and then extracted all the RNA sequences from platelets in the samples. They then trained an SVM to decide if a sample was cancer or non-cancer based on what RNA sequences were present or absent in the sample. They then validated on a separate dataset.

The putative mechanism for the test is that platelet cells in the blood have their RNA composition changed by being in close proximity to the cancer microenvironment as they circulate through the blood. The authors call this ""tumor education"" and suggest it may be due to the platelets picking up chemicals secreted by tumors as they pass by (along with a few other possibilities).

It is certainly an interesting result, but it is a very preliminary study with small N (55 healthy, 228 CA) and a relatively small number of cancer types.

The results on the validation set for CA/No CA were:
Sensitivity of 97%
Specificity of 94%
It should be noted that these are not really the most important numbers, which are actually the PPV and the NPV. These statistics, however, are heavily dependent on the characteristics of the population to be tested.

For comparison, the sensitivity and specificity of the PSA are approximately 21% and 91%. The sensitivity and specificity of mammography are approximately 68% and 75%. (These numbers are huge simplifications, but useful for comparison).

My overall feeling is that this is quite a promising avenue of research, and that we will soon see larger-scale trials. If they pan out, then it is likely that this test will find clinical use. Even if large-scale trials yield worse numbers, there still could be utility as a screening tool, especially if only applied in selected high-prevalence populations. So, definitely there is reason for excitement, but don't expect to be going to your doctor tomorrow and getting this cancer test. Years of testing and validation will be required before we can trust that this test actually works well. 

I realize some may feel that this is due to the community wanting to ""hide"" a promising test, but the truth is that it is important to validate tests before we use them because otherwise a bad test may lead to unnecessary morbidity, both psychological (i.e. telling someone who doesn't have cancer that they have cancer) and physical (unnecessary testing and associated exposure to radiation and/or surgeries)."

Twitter let those sites use their API, where the site's bots then crawled the pages of politicians and accounting for all their tweets. If a tweet was deleted, they would post the text up and the politician who posted it up on the site. 

However, Twitter shut them down by closing off their API access, making it virtually impossible to do what they had been doing before. They shut off the API access because they violated the ToS, which was that they couldn't display deleted tweets.

First off APIs provide an official backdoor for third parties to obtain information from a site about you, most of these are heavily regulated and generally require your authorization in order to obtain that information. Some sites, like Twitter, make all their public activities, in this case tweets, available without authorization. 

However under the terms of service in using Twitter's, and most others, when an application using the API is notified that an item was deleted they must also remove it from their system.This is where these sites got into trouble and the ""internal debate"" at Twitter took place. Under the terms this means that when a politician deleted a tweet, these site must also remove the tweet, which they don't because their whole purpose is to prevent this for politicians.

This rule requiring applications to delete tweets is blanket and applies to all Twitter accounts including yours. The spirit of this rule is to try and prevent that tweet you mistakenly made from being stuck out there and you can never take it back. So the debate at Twitter was, should this rule exclude politicians? And judging by the result it was no. With this decision these archiving sites were in violation of Twitter's terms of service, so their API access was revoked and were most likely sent DMCA requests to remove what tweets they had already copied since all tweets are technically copyrighted by Twitter thus shutting down the sites.

Whether or not you agree with Twitter's decision to not classify politicians accounts as exclusions to the deletion rule, Twitter's goal is to protect its users' right to privacy.

On a side note I have seen people mention that these sites could switch to web crawling to obtain these tweets. The answer is no they could not, probably. This comes back to tweets being copyrighted materials of Twitter, meaning they could make the case that by archiving the tweets without Twitter's permission they are violating the DMCA. Although the sites could argue that they are using the tweets in a review or editorial fashion thus excluding them from the DMCA. It would be an issue settled in court and who knows who would win."

> I.2.f Only surface Twitter activity as it surfaced on Twitter. For example, your Service should execute the unfavorite and delete actions by removing all relevant Content, not by publicly displaying to other users that the Tweet is no longer favorited or has been deleted.

But dragging a police officer - who was trying to do the right - through court, is really leaving a bitter taste in the mouth of the public.

Over 100 news agencies sitting in 100 contries all over the world are disclosing the panama papers tonight at the exact same time. This will be a huge hit for several large figures in world sports, politics and economy. Names like Lionel messi, Vladimir Putin and the prime minister of Iceland are already leaked. I am curious to see who turns up as well. What a leak!! All coordinated by German newspaper namely the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. As op linked to

Before reading further: 
Here is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by /u/Jaredlong:

>Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can ""spend"" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.

*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons! (thanks /u/Toppo) [orig. comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4d75i7/26_terabyte_leak_of_panamanian_shell_company_data/d1og7kz)*

Edit: 'Die Zeit' another big German newspaper writes that about 200k  letterbox companies (in total 11.5 million records) are disclosed... Jesus what is going on. This will be big news for the next few weeks (hopefully longer than that!)

Edit2: the icij had released a YouTube video [here:](https://youtu.be/F6XnH_OnpO0) which sums up what is in those documents. (Even if someone is speaking in the video very calm there is really disturbing stuff in there like people trafficking and sex slavery etc...)

Edit3: [here](https://panamapapers.icij.org/graphs)  are some graphs generated from the data showing it goes back to the 80s. The official site is very informative and what is in there. I guess they will also have them for download somewhere...

big hands to /u/AsshatVik composing the list of head of states (as /u/kaisermatias said, most of the names on the list are head of governments not head of states...):
    
    The 12 heads of state are:

    Mauricio Macri, president or Argentina.

    Bidzina Ivanishvill. ex PM of Georgia

    Sigmundur something something, PM of Iceland.

    Ayad H. Allawi, ex PM of Iraq.

    Pavlo Lazarenko, ex-PM of Ukraine.

    Petro Poroshenko, president of Ukraine.

    Update of /u/AsshatVik

    Mohammed VI of Morocco might also be involved. Mossack Fonseca created the company to which his personal yatch is registered.


    Family members of Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbajan also used Fonseca to manage mining and real estate investments.
     

    8 High echelon communist party members of People's Republic of China also used their services. Xi Jinping is amongst them, who's linked to two businesses in the British Virgin Islands.





edit 5:

edit 6: **For all germans**. There are germans on the list. No politicians (or other high stake figures) but new evidence on the siemens scandal (from the top of my head I don't know which he was referring to..;D) for example. Mossak Fonseca is helping germans massively in the act of tax evasion.  There is not a single german bank not on the list except ""Sparkasse"" etc... (those who are more or less government affiliated) **for non germans** not all names are already leaked since the journalists give those on the list the opportunity to comment on the accusation.

Ultimately, SZ acquired about 2.6 terabytes of data, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with.

The data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows.

The files include a convicted money launderer who claimed he’d arranged a $50,000 illegal campaign contribution used to pay the Watergate burglars, 29 billionaires featured in Forbes Magazine’s list of the world’s 500 richest people and movie star Jackie Chan, who has at least six companies managed through the law firm.

efore dawn on Nov. 26, 1983, six robbers slipped into the Brink’s-Mat warehouse at London’s Heathrow Airport. The thugs tied up the security guards, doused them in gasoline, lit a match and threatened to set them afire unless they opened the warehouse’s vault. Inside, the thieves found nearly 7,000 gold bars, diamonds and cash.

“Thanks ever so much for your help. Have a nice Christmas,” one of the crooks said as they departed.

British media dubbed the heist the “Crime of the Century.” Much of the loot - including the cash reaped by melting the gold and selling it - was never recovered. Where the missing money went is a mystery that continues to fascinate students of England’s underworld.

Now documents within Mossack Fonseca’s files reveal that the law firm and its co-founder, Jürgen Mossack, may have helped the conspirators keep the spoils out of the hands of authorities by protecting a company tied to Gordon Parry, a London wheeler-dealer who laundered money for the Brink’s-Mat plotters.

 On Feb. 10, 2011, an anonymous company in the British Virgin Islands named Sandalwood Continental Ltd. loaned $200 million to an equally shadowy firm based in Cyprus called Horwich Trading Ltd.

The following day, Sandalwood assigned the rights to collect payments on the loan - including interest - to Ove Financial Corp., a mysterious company in the British Virgin Islands.

For those rights, Ove paid $1.

But the money trail didn’t end there.

The same day, Ove reassigned its rights to collect on the loan to a Panama company called International Media Overseas.

It too paid $1.

In the space of 24 hours the loan had, on paper, traversed three countries, two banks and four companies, making the money all but untraceable in the process.

Family members of at least eight current or former members of China’s Politburo Standing Committee, the country’s main ruling body, have offshore companies arranged though Mossack Fonseca. They include President Xi’s brother-in-law, who set up two British Virgin Islands companies in 2009.

The leaked files show the firm regularly offered to backdate documents to help its clients gain advantage in their financial affairs. It was so common that in 2007 an email exchange shows firm employees talking about establishing a price structure - clients would pay $8.75 for each month farther back in time that a corporate document would be backdated.

The world’s best soccer player, Lionel Messi, is also found in the documents. The records show Messi and his father were owners of a Panama company: Mega Star Enterprises Inc. This adds a new name to the list of shell companies known to be linked to Messi. His offshore dealings are currently the target of a tax evasion case in Spain.

Not to mention direct implications of various other western puppets (Saudi King, Ukrainian PM, Iraqi former PM) and other dubious ""connections"".

Which is why it's good that this massive pile of data is analyzed by a huge load of international newspapers.

First, please allow me to say **thank you.** At a young and critical age when I had very few positive male role models in my life, you beautifully rendered in Captain Picard a powerful but temperate man worthy of emulation: externally rational but internally passionate, proud but grounded, diplomatic but resolute, shrewd but decisive. Your work as Picard as an immensely positive presence, and I believe seeing him as an alternative helped me break more fully away from the influence of an angry, embittered, abusive father. As I learned ever more about your childhood experiences and your positions on domestic violence and PTSD, I saw that the good man on-screen was occupied by a good man off-screen. So, at length: **thank you.**

My question:

What’s your favorite story about a Next Generation co-star behind-the-scenes that we may not know about?

P.S. You also helped me go bald with grace.

EDIT: Came back from a day of meetings to dozens of great comments - thanks everyone! Can't say I'm not disappointed that Sir Patrick didn't respond, but I got my first gilding, so that's pretty great. Thank you, gilder!

July 10 has been suggested as a no reddit day. Don't post, comment, or even load the site. Go through the weekend if you can.

Edit: If every person that thought ""this will never happen"" actually went along with it, it would happen. There seems to be a lot of people upset and few willing to even find something to do other than reddit for a few days. 

I'm open to other ideas, but this is the only hope normal users have to make any kind of meaningful impact here. 

EDIT2: spread the message guys, copy this comment on big subreddits, comment on high karma posts, make posts with this message. We need people to see this in order to work and to hit where it hurts!

EDIT3: Thanks for all the support guys, hopefully with this we can show that we, the users, have a say on how Reddit is managed.

The swerve was that there was one other guy on the planet who had the power, but couldn't use it. So time would jump and repeat and he didn't know why. He would remember everything about the skips but couldn't figure out what caused it until he saw the first guy on jeopardy, using his powers to get everything right.

I built in my neighbor's woods. He lived in California and was never there. I lived in Missouri. I'd go out there and sit when I wanted to get away from family and make things. When my dad died, we moved away. When I came back, I was talking to some of my old school friends. They tried catching me up on the last eight years. During the talk, I learned that they didn't know who'd built this little straw shack in the woods, but they'd been using as a hunting hut for about seven years till loggers came in and logged the woods, destroying it. 

Hearing that they got seven years out of something I built in my spare time made me feel good about myself. The thatch was time consuming though. The field I got the sage grass from was half a mile from the hut. I used to got out there and reap it with the butcher knife, tie it into bundles, then lug eight bundles at a time back to the hut.

He's reading their subconscious,  their body,  and doing all of those calculations BEFORE that poor rebel scum pulls the trigger.

He'd often beat authorities to the scene, then sell his gory photos to the tabloids.", CDNChaoZ, "From ""Weegee's New York"" by Harvey V. Fondiller, *Popular Photography*, June 1978.

> In the trunk of my Chevy I had two 4x5 Speed Graphics, a lotta film holders, a typewriter, and plenty of flashbulbs. Around five in the morning was the best time for the action. That's when people kill themselves or somebody else. I photographed a lot of corpses, but you know what -- I'm a very sensitive and artistic guy, and I hate the sight of blood. I sorta circle around the scene and take corpses from an angle that makes 'em look comfortable. By the way -- the easiest kind of job to handle is a stiff on the ground. It's good for two hours.  
An editor said to me, 'Weegee, ya got any new corpses?' I told him, 'Wait until tomorrow... I'll be around with some more merchandise.'

> Many photographers live in a dream world of beautiful backgrounds. It wouldn't hurt them to get a taste of reality to wake them up. Anyone who looks for life can find it... and they don't need to photograph ashcans. The average camera fan reminds me of Pollyanna, with a lollypop in one hand and a camera in the other. You can't be a Nice Nelly and take news pictures.
> So, keep your eyes open. If you see anything, take it. Remember -- you're only as good as your last picture. One day you're a hero, the next day you're a bum..."

The guy absolutely crushed it, everyone went nuts, and Billie Joe ended up signing the guitar and giving it to him. it was the coolest thing I'd ever seen and was actually the reason I started playing guitar myself. 
Coincidentally, later on in the show, Billie Joe legitimately stuck his hand down his pants and started playing with himself mid song. I was 12 and wasn't exactly sure what he was doing, but much like the way he inspired me to play guitar, this inspired me to try... Something else. "

Around 2002-03, David Bowie was on tour and he played my city. I had an acquaintance from da klubb who had cancer... 22 year old girl. Her cancer was so bad that tumors made it impossible for her to walk and she was in the hospital permanently when he came through. She left the hospital to see the show and she was the only person he let backstage. She was ecstatic. She immediately went back to the sterile cold hospital to deal with real life again... and the very next day he shows up unannounced to bring a little bit of happiness to her.

I hope he got all the support that he gave. It's not easy being around sick people, and he didn't have to. The world needs more people like him.

My dad said that David was the nicest guy, he would entrust my dad with loads of personal secrets and talk to him like he was a mate. My dad wasn't keen on his wife though, apparently she used to click her fingers at him and call him ""chauffeur"" rather than his name. There is one story that always sticks out for me, one night David gave my dad a call and said he wanted to go for a drive, so my dad picked him up and david directed him to a warehouse, he asked my dad to come in with him. My dad walked in with him only to find out the warehouse was empty, David asked my dad to get to the other end and the played frisbee for about 2 hours in this massive warehouse.

>The influential singer-songwriter and producer, who dabbled in glam rock, art rock, soul, hard rock, dance pop, punk and electronica during his eclectic 40-plus-year career, died after a battle with cancer. 

>Bowie’s artistic breakthrough came with 1972’s The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, an album that fostered the notion of rock star as space alien. Fusing British mod with Japanese kabuki styles and rock with theater, Bowie created the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust.

>Three years later, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the No. 1 single “Fame” off the Top 10 album Young Americans, then followed with the 1976 avant-garde art-rock LP Station to Station, which made it to No. 3 on the charts and featured Top 10 hit “Golden Years.”

>Other memorable songs included 1983’s “Let’s Dance” — his only other No. 1 U.S. hit — “Space Oddity,” “Heroes,” “Changes,” “Under Pressure,” “China Girl,” “Modern Love,” “Rebel, Rebel,” “All the Young Dudes,” “Panic in Detroit,” “Fashion,” “Life on Mars” “Suffragette City” and a 1977 Christmas medley with Bing Crosby.

>With his different-colored eyes (the result of a schoolyard fight) and needlelike frame, Bowie was a natural to segue from music into curious movie roles, and he starred as an alien seeking help for his dying planet in Nicolas Roeg’s surreal The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). Critics later applauded his three-month Broadway stint as the misshapen lead in 1980’s The Elephant Man."

Following an appearance on SNL in 1997, Bowie tells the tale of how he was banned from SNL

“I was banned from the show”

Earlier that week, Bowie had expressed interest in appearing in a sketch to Michaels over dinner one evening. Michaels let his writers know the next day and they came up with an idea which Bowie initially approved of. “The gist was that I was somehow roped into a low budget telly advert for a Brooklyn bakery. They wanted me to sing about their pastries or what have you. One of the things they came up with was a version of my song, ‘Watch That Man’. But instead, in the chorus I would sing, ‘Try our flan’.” Bowie took issue with the way the writers wanted him to pronounce the word “flan”. While either of the two main pronunciations is generally accepted, the veteran rock star and food connoisseur was miffed at saying it the “wrong” way.

“David is a man of the world,” said Michaels.

“He’s seen it all. And he takes food very seriously. I get that. But when you are running a big, live production like we are, last second changes can be complicated.”

While Bowie expressed misgivings throughout the week, he eventually agreed to do the sketch as written. But as the show was being broadcast live he changed his mind. He backed out after his first musical performance and the sketch had to be scrapped and replaced.

Late-game changes are nothing new to Saturday Night Live. The show is more than prepared to handle sudden disruptions. And although Bowie’s late decision to bow out of the sketch did anger Michaels, it was not what ultimately got him the boot.

“I was scheduled to perform a single from my ‘Earthling’ album called ‘Telling Lies’. Just before the band took the stage I decided to take the piss out of Lorne a bit because I knew he wasn’t happy with me.”

What happened next may have looked completely innocuous to the viewing public, but it was a deliberate statement that cut one man to his core.

Instead of the new single, the band played 1981’s “Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)”, a song that Michaels confessed to Bowie in private was “absolutely terrifying” to him.

“We got to talking about this and that at dinner one night and Lorne’s SNL hiatus in the early 80s came up. He told me how it was the darkest period of his life and he described how much cocaine he did while listening to my “Scary Monsters” album. Just mountains and mountains of the stuff. Sometimes straight off the record sleeve. Those were his words. I want that to be clear about that.”

When the song was over, Bowie was immediately escorted from the studio

> David Bowie has died many deaths yet he is still with us. He is popular music’s ultimate Lazarus: Just as that Biblical figure was beckoned by Jesus to emerge from his tomb after four days of nothingness, Bowie has put many of his selves to rest over the last half-century, only to rise again with a different guise. This is astounding to watch, but it's more treacherous to live through; following Lazarus’ return, priests plotted to kill him, fearing the power of his story. And imagine actually being such a miracle man—resurrection is a hard act to follow.

6 years ago a kitten came out of the woods and my dad, on his way to my mother's house (they had divorced) picked him up. My mother started nursing him back to health, and gave him to my little brother.

My little brother was living with me at the time. He fed the kitten poptarts and was upset about the kittens lack of bladder control. He said, and I quote, ""I opened up a 2 pack of pop tarts and started eating one and feeding him the other, I like to nibble on it and I was breaking him off chunks of the other one I was going to eat next. Then, I finished mine and realized he had finished his too. AND HE PEED ALL OVER THE PLACE, ALL ON MY BED AND MY SHIRT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WrONG WITH HIM.""

This happened at least three times (that he told me of). Apparently, he thought that cats were predators who stalked artificial strawberry goo wrapped in chalk-bread. I have always had a cat allergy and didn't like cats, so I didn't bother correcting him.
Anywho, one day he left out of town to visit his girlfriend and wanted me to baby sit the kitten-cat.

And here we are, 6 fuckin years later, and I've still got him, and he bites, and scratches, and seems to have some undiagnosed Vietnam-war syndrome from time to time.

But he's my favorite friend. And he scratched the fuck out of my finger, probably because my [I'ma name him George](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=george+love+him+and+hug+him+and+squeeze+him+forever&FORM=VIRE4#view=detail&mid=99A6898CD841753C731C99A6898CD841753C731C) joke when I find him burrowed in my clothes got a little too old and redundant for his tastes.

The guy says sure, and he selects a collie, gives her a command, and she goes running full blast up the mountain/hill outside of his house.

Then the farmer says, ""Okay, it's cold out, let's go inside for some tea and watch her work.""   They actually went inside and sat at the window while the collie gathered all the sheep (constantly checking behind to make sure none were left behind), drove them down the mountain and to the farm.  Then the farmer put on his jacket, went outside and opened the fence to the barn area to bring the sheep in and said, ""Good girl.""  Job done in 30 minutes with ONE command.

We are fighting to eradicate the idea that a living being can be reduced to a simple object through possession.

They have a vast array of emotions just like us. The only thing that they don´t do is speak a human language. By giving them love and respect to the extreme, as well as taking care of their basic needs of course, the interactions that our team shares with them have become something magical and extremely magnetic.

They have the ability to rip you limb from limb and have you for dinner. The man in this video is named Eduardo and he is the president of Black Jaguar White Tiger (BJWT) Foundation in Mexico. His foundation rescues animals from captivity and neglect (often from the same circuses where you would go to watch them perform). His organization has gained over 3 million followers on instagram now, and he has been doing a phenomenal job with providing luxurious habitat for them to spend their time in versus the cages they are kept in all day at the circus. As cuddly and incredibly friendly as they may seem, they are extremely dangerous even as juvenilles if you do not have (and sometimes even when you do) have a great understanding of their behavioral patterns which vary from one individual to the next just like us humans. Just like Eddy would say: ""A lion is a lion is a lion.""

So please, if you are considering keeping a big cat as a pet, understand that they can't live in your apartment or even house without something going wrong eventually. In the case of big cats something going wrong could just be them being in an off mood or them being picky over something you did. Their behavior towards being moody varies but their is always a chance of the situation becoming deadly or lead to the cat causing immense bodily harm. These animals should be treated with respect at all times and if you wish to ignore my warnings then so be it, but at the very least make a wild cat sanctuary or build a large enclosure on your property to devote to the animal if not for your sake then for the animals well being. Thank you for reading friend. "

USA: Hey, Norway [for example], I was visiting you the other week and I noticed you've got, like, no homeless people. How'd you manage that? 

NORWAY: It's quite simple, really. First, you make massive investments in your health care infrastructure, such that physical and mental disabilities are dealt with promptly and at no cost by competent medical professionals. Of course, to have enough doctors to go around, you need a really top-notch educational system, again made freely available to everyone regardless of personal financial circumstances. Then, you throw shit-tons of money at vocational and professional training, job placement services, free state-run child-care programs, inter- and intra-city transportation systems, social welfare programs, and drug and alcohol counseling. And, of course, since homelessness springs from not being able to afford a home, you make sure that there are enough safe and comfortable living spaces for everyone to live in with dignity, regardless of their financial means.

Some days I feel really shitty about it, because it's not even coming close to solving the problem and in many cases makes it worse. But then we have several parks, created and maintained by city employees, volunteers, and tax payers, that no one can use due to homeless issues. You can't even take your kids to one of our playgrounds because it's camped out by some seriously disturbed people. Another really beautiful park is littered with beer cans, condom wrappers, and crack pipes. 

Letting people sleep in the park is a poor stopgap that isn't actually *helping* anyone--it's just a passive way to not address the root of homelessness.

Ladar Levison, owner of the now defunct email service, has been forbidden since then, under threat of contempt and possibly jail time, from identifying who the government was investigating. In court documents from the case unsealed in late 2013, all information that could identify the customer was redacted.

But federal authorities recently screwed up and revealed the secret themselves when they published a cache of case documents but failed to redact one identifying piece of information about the target: his email address, Ed_Snowden@lavabit.com. With that, the very authorities holding the threat of jail time over Levison’s head if he said anything have confirmed what everyone had long ago presumed: that the target account was Snowden’s.

Document from the Lavabit case mistakenly made public by the government showing Edward Snowden’s email address was the target of the 2013 investigation.
The documents were posted on March 4 to the federal court system known as Pacer as part of Levison’s long battle for transparency in the case that ruined his business. They were spotted this week by the transparency site Cryptome and published online.

Here’s a quick recap of that case: On June 28, 2013, shortly after newspapers published the first NSA leaks from Snowden, FBI agents showed up at Levison’s door in Texas and served him with a pen register order requiring him to give the government metadata for the email activity of one customer’s account.

The case was initially sealed and the public didn’t learn about it and the fight over Levison’s customer until after he had shuttered his email service in defiance of the government. But even after he closed Lavabit and there was no hope of the government obtaining information about the account that it had been seeking, the target was never identified. When some of the documents in the case were finally unsealed in redacted form in October 2013, however, the unredacted parts left little doubt that the Lavabit case was about Snowden, who was known to be using a Lavabit account in the spring of 2013 when his first NSA leaks were published and when he was hiding in a safe house in Hong Kong. It was still an educated guess, however.

Cut to now. With the Lavabit case long ended, Levison has kept fighting to get more of the documents unsealed and unredacted. He’s been using money raised by supporters back in 2013 to fund the fight for transparency. He filed a motion in December asking an appeals court to unseal documents and vacate a non-disclosure order that has silenced him about the target. It turns out he was a little more successful in that latter request than he thought he was—with a little help from a government error. After a hearing earlier this year, a court denied his motion to unseal and vacate but ordered US attorneys in the case to re-release all “previously filed pleadings, transcripts, and orders” with everything unredacted except “the identity of the subscriber and the subscriber’s email address.” After some negotiation, the government got the court to agree to let it redact other information as well that might harm its investigation into the target.

Then the government messed up. When the documents were re-posted to Pacer this month, Snowden’s Lavabit email address was left unredacted in plain sight in an August 2013 document.

When asked for comment, Levison’s lawyer Jesse Binnall told WIRED in an email that “due to the letter and spirit of the court’s January 7, 2016 order, Lavabit has no further comment on the unredacted email address.”

Binnall is referencing the January 2016 order in which the court denied Levison’s motion to unseal records and vacate the non-disclosure order in the case.

WIRED spoke with Levison, prior to his learning that the government had made the redaction error, about his struggle to obtain transparency. “Three years later, I still cannot tell you who they were after. I keep getting asked the question, and I can’t answer.”

Now, it appears he doesn’t have to. The government has answered for him.  "

>To Our Dedicated Patients & Supporters:

>For years, The Breast Cancer Society has been dedicated to providing assistance to those suffering from breast cancer.

>The vast majority of money raised for breast cancer causes are spent to fund research. While research and education are both vital, thousands of victims of breast cancer each year need not only information and the hope for an eventual cure, but also require direct assistance today so that they and their families can meet the challenges of this disease.

>And so, I created an organization dedicated to providing direct assistance, supplies and referral services to those battling breast cancer. I am especially proud to have created The Hope Supply Program, which has allowed us to partner with retailers and manufacturers to provide personal care supplies and much-needed items (wigs, prosthetic breast inserts, and post-mastectomy bras, for example) for patients and their families free of charge.

>Charities – including some of the world’s best-known and reputable organizations – are increasingly facing the scrutiny of government regulators in the U.S. The Breast Cancer Society (TBCS) is no exception. Unfortunately, as our operations expanded – all with the goal of serving more patients – the threat of litigation from our government increased as well.

>While the organization, its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrong doing, and the government has not proven otherwise, our Board of Directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve, and those who remain in need, for us to engage in a highly publicized, expensive, and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices.

>The silver lining in all of this is that the organization has the ability to continue operating our most valued and popular program, the Hope Supply. Our Board will work tirelessly to maintain the Hope Supply program services that have benefitted our many patients for years – initially under the TBCS banner as it transitions under a different organization – all with the goal of seamlessly providing services to you.

Since you're buddies with Simon, you'd be able to guess what junk food they're gonna eat next based on what they ate before and you'd also be able to guess what they had eaten based on the wrappers and boxes left over. However, even though you're buddies with Fat Albert, he's just so huge that when he gets near enough something to eat, he swallows it wrapper and all. You have no idea what he'd eat next or what he ate before because he swallowed anything and everything near him. BUT NOW, all of a sudden, you realize that Albert is not only fat, but he's a messy eater. Because of this, you realize that there are crumbs, smudges, and pieces of the food left around his mouth. So you're like, OH! Now I know what you ate. Maybe in time you could use that to learn his eating habits just like you know your buddy Simon's!

So in this case, you're Mr Hawking, and you realized that the black hole, Albert, although he seemed not to leave evidence of food (information), actually might leave that evidence at the edge of his mouth (the event horizon = the edge of the black hole). You can use that to figure out all sorts of things!

For people who are still a little confused by what the theory is, and why I talked about Simon:
The original thing that we thought was what I described at the beginning, that for any normal scenario (a Simon) we would be able to get information, but in the case of a black hole (Albert), we can't. But Hawking's theory is your theory that if you look at the edge of his mouth, you can see the crumbs and figure out a pattern to how he's eating just like you did with a normal case like Simon. In the same way, looking at the event horizon (the ""edge"" of a black hole) might let you get the information that we before thought was destroyed. Hope that makes sense!"

Basically, black holes have been considered to ""destroy information"" which basically means you can't see what's inside a black hole. This is a big problem in physics because energy/matter/information can't be ""destroyed.""

What Hawking is saying now is that the information isn't destroyed, but instead sort of ""imprinted"" on the event horizon of a black hole.

An event horizon is what we might consider the border of inside vs outside the black hole. Everything past that line is ""inside"" the black hole and can't be seen because even light gets trapped in it. But if an object or particle enters ~~a stable~~ orbit on that boundary, special things happen that I don't understand and can't really describe.

However, I can say that what Hawking is saying is that if something crosses this barrier, it effects how the event horizon looks, and therefore in a way, we can retrieve that information, kind of like looking at footprints in the snow leading up to the edge of a cliff.

I may be way off base here, but that's my understanding and I invite anyone with a better understanding to ELI5 to me.

Edit: there is no stable orbit on the event horizon."
3285, "ELI5: Stephen Hawking's new theory on black holes", mugwump3, "Hey everybody -- I'm in Sweden right now with the guy, and was in the room yesterday when he gave his technical lecture to us.

There are many things still to work out, so we really call this an ""idea"" rather than a theory, but that being said, we're busy debating about it!

Hawking's idea is a proposal to solve a major crises in black hole physics -- what's been called the ""firewall / information paradox."" It's been know for a while now that black holes conserve information of in falling matter. (See previous example of Albert and Simon eating junk food) -- anything that goes into a black hole is gone forever.... Kind of. The metaphor I like best is to think of an encyclopedia and all the knowledge it contains. Throwing it into a black hole is like throwing it into a furnace... Out of the furnace comes a big pile of ashes from the encyclopedia that, in theory, could be reconstructed atom by atom to be an encyclopedia again. In practice however, this is beyond difficult. 

This argument (called ""holography""h has held up really well! But... it was found to violate one of three unbreakable laws of quantum physics! A well known proposed solution to this conflict is the hypothetical ""black hole firewall"" that argues the encyclopedia never makes it into the center of the furnace, it just ""incinerates"" at the furnaces entrance (the ""event horizon""). 

Yesterday, Hawking proposed his own solution that he's been working on with Andy Strominger. He argues that the information from the encyclopedia is conserved because the ashes are a ""super translation"" of the original encyclopedia.  So, what the hell is a super translation? In ""group algebra"" translations are simply how one group ""moves"" along some defined dimension -- stand 3 meters from the wall. Now walk to the wall. Congratulations! You have just ""translated"" along a single dimension of space. 

A super translation is much more technically sophisticated than that, but it's the same basic principle. It has symmetry -- and that's very important. Symmetry means you can walk towards the wall, or the wall can move to you. Makes no diff.) Hawking argues that the ""ashes"" are super translations of the information content of the in falling encyclopedia. Because of symmetries inherent to that mathematical object, using a super translation approach may resolve the nasty paradoxes. 

Tl;dr (read in Hawking's voice) ""our calculations about black holes suck. Let's try using 'super translation' mathematics instead."""
3286, "ELI5: Stephen Hawking's new theory on black holes", Justicles13, "Hawking's new claim is that you can, in fact, escape a black hole, and that information isn't destroyed as a result of entering a black hole's event horizon. Here's the ELI5 version:

What was previously thought is that information was lost in a black hole, and that it was permanently gone after the black hole had fully radiated away, the information was lost. What hawking says is that the information isn't lost, but it's now in a disorganized, useless form, solving the information paradox. 

Edit: ~~information meaning physical information, so it's like saying all physical matter becomes the same once entering a black hole. Physical information is the ability to tell what a physical system is and used to be based on the state it's in, but the paradox comes about when a black hole is brought up because all of a sudden the physical systems are all the same in a black hole, with no way to tell what the system used to be when the black hole radiates. Hawking is saying the information isn't destroyed, but it's just in a useless form to us.~~ For a better explanation of information, see /u/Snuggly_Person 's explanation

Can someone who is more knowledgeable than me confirm something? Black Holes are sort of like a super charged entropy increasers.

 It's easier to think of this in two dimensions, where the fabric of space is like the fabric of a trampoline, and the black hole is a manufactured hole in the center of that trampoline. The fabric of the trampoline is pulled taught around the hole and the hole is pulled downward toward the ground as if it were, somehow, really heavy. 
Now, what we used to think is: if you were to roll a ball toward the hole (but not directly into the hole) it would begin to circle the hole until gravity eventually pulls it into the hole.
But, what we think now is: the ball that we roll can only exist when it is on the fabric of the trampoline. The ball will keep rolling in circles around the hole forever but never fall into the hole because the hole has no fabric.

3293, "ELI5: Stephen Hawking's new theory on black holes", zeidrich, "I hate the top voted (Fat Albert) answer because it's confusing and misleading.  That answer implies that you can get useful information from the leftovers, which isn't true. 

The problem is that for our universe to exist the way we expect it to, we need there to be conservation of something.  At first we just thought it was conservation of mass.  

Basically, if you had 1kg of something, later you're still going to still have 1kg of something, and to get it you can put together 2 things that are 500g. Those things aren't going to change.   You're not going to have a closed system where the 500g thing becomes 700g without some outside interference, and you're not going to have 1kg which becomes 800g without sending that mass somewhere.

If those things could happen, our whole universe would be weird and unstable and wouldn't work the way we observe it to.

So the next thing that we realized was a little more about the nature of matter and of relativity.  Essentially that mass and energy are essentially the same things.  So that leads to understanding things like processes that convert mass to energy like radiation or nuclear fission.  So it means that mass isn't necessarily conserved, but the combination of mass and energy is. As we learned more, we started the find more ways that energy is kind of kept in stuff.  It's more than just the kind of energy that we think about that pushes things around, it's also responsible for properties of everything.

I mean, if you have something like fission and one atom can turn into two different atoms, plus a lot of energy, there's more than just the mass of those atoms and the energy, there's also the fact that they ARE those atoms and those photons, and not some other configuration.  We also know for it to change between one configuration and another might take or release energy from the system, so there's actually energy IN that configuration. 

So what we decided was that hey, we've said that mass is energy, and energy is energy, and something is configured in such a way that some of this stuff stays stuck together, and some of has no rest mass and can't stay in one place.  But we're sick of just calling everything energy, because that's misleading.  So we'll call ALL of this stuff information. Information is the mass, and the energy, and the way it's configured, and a whole bunch of stuff about it. 

So the thing is information is conserved, of course it can change, but the amount of it is always still around.  So you have some fission and that information defines the initial state and the end state and it's the same amount of information. 

But the problem is with black holes.  Black holes as they're generally thought of essentially break time.  We know when we have fission, that at point A we have so much information, and at point B after they've undergone fission, we have the same amount of information, but it describes a different system (with its resulting products and energy) 

But in black holes it's kind of like we have point A, and point B will never exist because time stops working properly in the black hole. 

So this kind of breaks how we think of the universe.  If we had 100 units of information before, and it falls into a black hole, and we will never have any information again from that, then it's not being conserved.  If that's the case, the universe shouldn't have really got started the way we think it did.

What Hawking discovered was that black holes emit radiation.  Radiation is information.  

What happens is first there's nothing.  Then out of nothing you get two things, one is some information, and the other is a debt for that amount of information.  It's kind of like you have some flat ground, and you make a hole.  You don't make any more dirt, you've just made a hole, and another area you've made it a pile.  Now that can just happen anywhere, but the dirt will just fall back into the hole, because you're not ""actually"" doing anything, you're not doing any work, you're just saying to the ground ""This part is the pile, and the empty part around it is the hole""  

But sometimes what happens is that the black hole incorporates things, sometimes it just gets the hole, and the dirt stays behind.  (now it can't just get the dirt and miss the whole for reasons that exceed the analogy)  Then the black hole, which is a giant pile, has a bit of itself fall into that little hole that it incorporated.  This continues to happen until the giant pile is flat and the black hole disappears.

So that kind of explains the life cycle of a black hole, but there's still a bunch of information that gets into the black hole but doesn't get out.  With the hole and pile explanation here, you're creating new dirt, and destroying a piece of the pile in the black hole, which still has a bit of a problem because things still only really make sense when information doesn't get created and destroyed.  

So instead the idea is kind of like all of that information in the black hole sits right on the edge.  When those holes get pulled in, what gets left behind is a bit of that information that went in.  Now it's all messed up beyond any recognition, but it's the same stuff as went in.  You can't tell what went in by looking at what came out (unlike the fat albert analogy) but if you knew what went in, and you looked at what came out, you could confirm that what came out was some potential configuration of what went in. 

A better conclusion to the Fat Albert analogy is that Albert eats all of those candies, and you think, Oh dear, those candies have to go somewhere. They can't just stop existing.   But as Fat Albert moves around and you observe him from outside of the range that he's going to eat you, you smell stinky farts, and little piles of poop on the ground.  You know that on some level those gasses and poops were once your beloved candies, but they're different now. 

Eventually Fat Albert dies, and you do a bunch of research and find out that, yes, if you tally up all of the farts, and all of the poops, and all of the decaying matter of Fat Albert's corpse, it's possible that the Fat Albert you knew before he became a black hole, plus all of those candies that he ate after he became a black hole could have created the exact same poops, farts and decayed remains as you see here. This just takes a very very long time.

A turns into B... eventually. 

Without considering that, we have a situation where Fat Albert slowly turns to nothing, and some new material from nowhere kind of replaces him, which breaks some things about how we understand the universe to work.

But it doesn't mean we can look at B and figure out A.  It's just that we can look at B and A, and say, yeah, A could have turned into B. 

It's like how you could squirt a happy face of ketchup on to your macaroni and cheese, and then stir it around.  In the end, you could take a look at that mixed up ketchup and say ""Yeah, it's got the amount of ketchup that I would expect from that happy face that we mixed in.  But you wouldn't be able to take a look at a bowl of stirred ketchupy macaroni and say ""Yeah, it had certainly had a face on it before it got stirred."" because it could have been anything before it got stirred."

I get that when a moving particle whizzes past me, I affect it and it affects me and maybe the trajectory or the frequency or the amplitude (or spin or whatever) might get altered, and it can all be ""recovered"" in some way.  But then you get to the Neutron Star phase when all matter is simply compressed without empty space - it seems that all of those frequencies, amplitudes and spins are lost.  Personally, I have no issues with that!  But the ""Black Hole"" goes way beyond that - so what is being lost and saved?  Can we use a detector to figure out that 15,000 years ago a left-spin positron was merged with two right-spin quarks, one strange and the other red?

A charge is only ""real"" against your account when it's posted.  It's posted when the merchant does their batch close (typically) except for debit.  When you do a credit transaction there is an authorization against your account but you don't ""owe"" the money until it posts.  

Refunds to debit if done at a POS terminal should be automatic (just like charges).

Refunds to credit take time because they go through the same path as charges.  If it took 3 days for your charge to post you can be assured it will take 3 days for the refund to post.

Now why don't they just authorize refunds?  I suspect because when you auth a charge no money has changed hands yet.  The bank [or credit company] still has the money they were lending you.  It only goes to the merchant when they do a batch close and post the transaction.  So if they did an auth refund there would be two copies of the same money.  You'd have your refund and the merchant wouldn't have had to cough up the money yet.

See, when you buy something, it takes a few days for the merchant to get their money. You don't notice or care about it because the money is gone out of your account and you have your stuff. 

In the event of a refund, though, you are suddenly painfully aware of how long it takes money to move through the credit card processing system. "
3300, "ELI5: Why does it take 5 seconds for credit card/debit card companies to take money out of my account but 5 days for them to refund it?", Shagomir, "Okay. I used to work for a credit card processor. Here's how it works. 

Purchase:

1. The customer buys something. The merchant's bank checks with the customer's bank to make sure the customer has funds in their account, and the customer's bank puts a hold on the account in the amount- this hold is called the authorization. **This is what makes it appear as if the charge hits your card right away**
2. The merchant's bank has to settle the transaction. This costs money, so it's usually done in batches by the payment processor. They settle at least once a day. 
3. The settlement takes up to 72 hours to process. Once the funds are sent from the customer's bank to the merchant's bank, the settlement appears on the customer's account, the funds are withdrawn, and the authorization is cancelled.
4. The merchant's bank updates the merchant's account to show that the funds have been received. This can take up to 24 hours. 
4. It's been 1-5 days, and everyone has their money now. The transaction is complete. 

For a refund, the process is the same, but done in reverse:

1. The customer requests a refund. The merchant's bank requests a refund transaction from the bank. The bank checks with the merchant's bank to make sure they have the funds, and puts a hold on the amount. 
2. The customer's bank has to settle the transaction.  This costs money, so it's usually done in batches by the payment processor. They settle at least once a day. 
3. The settlement takes up to 72 hours to process. Once the funds are sent from the merchant's bank to the customer's bank, the settlement appears on the merchant's bank's account, the funds are withdrawn, and the authorization is cancelled.
4. The customer's bank updates the customer's account to show that the funds have been received. This can take up to 24 hours. 
4. It's been 1-5 days, and everyone has their money now. The refund is complete. 

This is the way the credit system is designed. Charges are ""instant"" because of authorizations. The authorization is a courtesy to show you how much you owe in pending transactions and help prevent you from overdrawing the account. It always takes time for the receiver of the payment to get the money - the Merchant gives you the stuff when they get the authorization, but don't get the money for several days. When you get a refund, the flow is reversed. 

It's not a conspiracy to squeeze extra interest out of your payment, it basically just has to be this way so the credit system works inside the existing regulations and systems in place for bank-to-bank account transfers.  

Does that make sense? "

The guy actually charged him for $475.00 and apologized for it.  It took 4 days before the money was put back into his bank account and the worst part about it was they made him also pay for the pizza.

Now, I know you're saying almost $50 is a lot for pizza and they shouldn't have to take a loss because of this but how many people have $525 in their account to where they can not have it for a few days?

3306, "ELI5: Why does it take 5 seconds for credit card/debit card companies to take money out of my account but 5 days for them to refund it?", PinkyThePig, "Because the credit card system could be thought of as a hack on top of ACH transfers (which take several days).

Basically, when ever you run your card, the cc machine dials out and contacts your bank to see if you have funds available. When your bank confirms they do, they put a hold on those funds, expecting the business to eventually collect on them.

When the business does a settlement at the end of the night, that is what actually starts the process of transfering the funds out of your account. 2-3 days later, they actually receive the funds.

If the business doesn't do a settlement, the bank eventually realize ""hey, it's not very likely that the business will be collecting on this authorization, lets put it back in the customers account"".

Otherwise, if they do a refund, it is basically a 'push' ACH transaction which if you have ever done one, take a few days for the funds to show up."

Back in the days when people used checks more regularly to buy stuff, and when it took a few days to process the check and see if it clears or bounces, some people took to the art of floating checks, also known as kiting checks. They'd write a check, knowing that they didn't have the bank balance to cover it at the moment, but counted on the processing delay to give them time to get some money deposited.

Individuals float checks. Banks float your deposits.

They do it because it makes money. If they can hold on to your money for a few days, for ""processing"", they can lend that money, and make profit on it.

And they make billions doing this on millions of people's deposits.

They can do this because they're financial institutions with economic and political power, and you're not.

3308, "ELI5: Why does it take 5 seconds for credit card/debit card companies to take money out of my account but 5 days for them to refund it?", lostintransactions, "I am a merchant, I get the payment the next day, on refunds they take the money the next day. Also, you are not having your money taken in 5 seconds, you are getting an authorization for the amount in 5 seconds, and a hold placed on that amount, it doesn't actually come out until the transaction is batch processed.

You have made a purchase, a promise to make the payment and the bank must ""hold"" that amount until it's cleared in one way or another to prevent you from going to 100 stores and going over your limits.

YOU are initiating the transaction, so you are ""charged"" instantly. 

It depends on the bank on when the customer gets the money back, it is usually (from experience of customers calling me) 2 days, but sometimes up to 7 and in some cases it's been virtually the same time frame as mine. If you are waiting longer than that your bank is withholding your money (your local bank) purposefully.

Bottom line on the disparate time frames: The banks are using the money for interest (my opinion).

There is a lot of guesses and misinformation in this thread.

**Myth:** Merchants batch over days.

***Reality:*** Merchant either do transaction by transaction (if volume is high and transaction fees are low) or batch at the end of the day. NO merchant waits more than 24 hours as authorizations ""expire"".

**Myth:** Merchants are keeping the money

***Reality:*** Merchants have no say in the matter, it's entirely the processor and bank.

**Myth:** Different systems

***Reality:*** While there are of curse different system, the system is not built this way, authorizations are made to the issuing bank instantly. Once authorized, the batch process is what moves the money electronically, it is instant and has nothing to do with the disparate systems, to belong to the system you need to be available to the system.  You can not use a bank card or credit card that cannot be charged in the system.  If you are a merchant and you are waiting more than 24 hours for a deposit of payment, you are in a high risk business and have agreed to that particular length of time.  

**Myth:**  What banks are liable for and that being part of the delays

***Reality:*** Banks (from your local credit union to the big CITI/VISA) are not liable for anything. The merchant is liable for every penny.  All fraud (every single penny) is taken from the merchant.  There is NO risk at all for Citibank, or any ban or card issuer.

**Myth:**  They are jerks, greedy or some other insult

***Reality:*** Business rules are set by the government, no one is being a ""jerk"" they (Banks and credit issuers) are simply following the shitty rules for consumers and merchants alike."

So you buy something for $10, Visa pays the $10 for you and just waits to get the $10 from your bank. 

When there is a refund nothing is done to make the process look faster. During a refund all of the parties wait for the money to actually complete the ACH transfer process before the balance shows anywhere in your balance.

If I can hold on to your $100 for 5 days, I might earn a few pennies with it which will hedge against inflation, which means by the time you get your $100 it's worth has gone down by a few pennies.  It's most likely not even a few pennies, probably much less than that.

You might think this isn't going to earn much money, but if you imagine a company guided by this thought process, you can see how across the board, they are better off financially.  

Everyone can talk about how it's different systems and it doesn't work the same and we just don't understand - yeah - that's bull.  This could easily be a same day refund as many companies I have dealt with have done same day refunds, it's not some magic technology that's on the cutting edge of what humanity has created thus far.  

There are all kinds of companies though that will do this kind of stuff.  Target, for example, won't post a refund to your credit card for three days.  Why?  Well if they aren't going to make money off of you for that initial purchase, they'll need to make money in the slightest way to help pay for the operational cost of doing that refund. 

This reason alone is why setting up your deductions so you get the smallest tax refund possible but the biggest paychecks possible is the best route to take.  You're allowing government to hold on to that money and in turn make more money off of it, but by the time you get it back, it's worth slightly less than it would have been had you gotten it in your paychecks."

3315, "ELI5: Why does it take 5 seconds for credit card/debit card companies to take money out of my account but 5 days for them to refund it?", youcancallmejay, "There are a few things at play:

1. When you buy something with a debit card, the merchant's computer will ask your bank ""is there enough money in the account to cover this?"" The bank's computer will respond, ""why, yes! Let me set this portion of money aside for your transaction."" This is an authorization. They've removed the money from your account, and set it aside for later. 

2. Within a day or so, your bank will collect all the money that it has set aside from all the transactions for the period (usually the work day) and process (i.e. pay) at that time. The money is still in your bank's hands, you just don't have access to it, because the bank reserved that money for your merchant.

3. The same works in reverse. If you pay from your bank to your credit card, your bank sets aside the money for the payment, and then actually makes the transfer later. It does this so it can ""batch"" (make a bunch of transfers at one time.)

This is ancient technology, as batches aren't really necessary any more. There are a few reasons that they still do this:

1. It's embraced inefficiency. It's always been this way. There was a major overhaul about ten years ago concerning checks (which is why you can photodeposit now), and that was such a PITA. 

2. It can assist in detecting fraud, criminal activity and mistakes, as the money isn't technically transferred in real time. (This is more for transactions in the USA.)

3. Banks can make money on the ""float"". During the temporary period where the money is in the bank's possession, but not credited against your credit card, the bank can still earn interest for the day or two delay. Multiply this times thousands of transactions per hour, and you have some significant reasons not to speed things up. Paypal actually has this built into the second business model.

4. Banks have one of the most powerful lobbies in the USA, and politicians will do what they can to ensure that nothing harms the trade. Banks literally make the economic world go around. If the status quo keeps things operating smoothly, and keep things profitable, and don't fund terror, the politicians will keep them that way. "

Here at least, this is what happens when you pay/get a refund on the unit:

1. If offline, the transaction is verified locally, most visa/mastercard cards support this, it's then stored on the terminal in the SnF-list (Store and forward)

2. If online, the transaction is sent to an organization (idk the name in english) which collects all of the transactions. This is propagated to your bank, which locks the funds until the process is complete.

3. When the merchant chooses (usually after finishing for the day) the merchant closes the batch, and sends a batch close to the same organization. This is a total sum of all the money, as well as the amount of transactions (split over acquirers such as visa/mastercard, amex etc) The acquirer responds with it's own summary, and if matching, it's OK'd. If it's not matching, the merchant gets a warning about the missmatch.

4. At 02:00-03:00 each night, the batch close is processed at the organization, which handles 1..n bank's money, and sends it out to the banks for processing.

5. The money is then transferred the next day.

When you are getting refunds due to payment processing errors, you usually complain to the merchant, which noticed the missmatch in the clsoe batch receipt, then calls the terminal manufacturer/processing organization, (it's the processing organization which can help, but the terminal manufacturer often act as a middle man/support). One the news reaches the processing organization, they verify that there's a missmatch, then sends a counter processing order to the bank.

What you are comparing is the initial freeze of the funds (as your transaction is authorized/leaves the offline storage ) with a 3 party process which involves busy merchants/organizations, 3 parties which go through the batch closes to find missmatch info and compare it to the transaction list in order to get a grip on what has occured.

If the return is due to a non-processing error, ie the merchant is refunding you directly, the funds travel to your bank account exactly the same way as it goes from yours to the merchant, and therefore arrives in (usually) 1-2 days after the merchant actually get its hands out of its ass and issues the refund."

For a refund, a credit card company has to have a process to control hundreds of millions, so needs many approvals and controls to ensure many millions don't get erroneously paid out.

It is verifying that the funds are available or that the card company will clear the transaction. When an item is memo posted to your account it is a temporary hold from the people that charged the card. This hold can remain on the account for days depending on the information submitted by the people who ran the card.

When a transaction posts to your account the transaction information has been uploaded by the people who ran the transaction. This is why we cannot file a fraud claim until the transaction actually posts. When a credit hits your account by way of debit card or an electronic transaction called an ACH it is hard posted immediately. Those funds are sent with the information. When a company refunds something on your card the same ""memo posting"" information applies. The transaction does not hard post your account until their information file is uploaded. 

The reason this process takes multiple days is because of all the systems these transactions actually run through before it is complete. When you swipe your card their system does a quick check. I would compare this to looking in the fridge to check how much milk you have. You look really quick and make a quick yes or no decision. This is why if their system isn't communicating correctly or if your cards verification system is down it declines. It doesn't mean that you don't have the funds necessarily, there are a lot of different reasons. Then after you leave with your purchase they hold your information until they send their transactions to their card processor. Then the card processor sends the information through the major credit card company, like Visa and MasterCard. Then the card company send the information to the bank.

You can watch the live thread of unfolding news [here](https://www.reddit.com/live/wp1fvdxxwb45/).

In business, you can avoid taxes by investing in something. If a company makes one million dollars, but spends 500,000 on investing in new technology for their product or something like that, they're only taxed from the remaining 500,000 because that's all of their ""profit."" (I'm not a businessman so I'm not sure on the complete legality of all the kinds of spending but I think this is a basic summary). This is all normal and fine; all companies require investing in order to grow their company.
 
So a company in Panama basically made a business in creating fake businesses. Companies could ""invest"" million of dollars and then it wouldn't be taxed, because according to legal documents it isn't profit, it's an ""investment,"" which is untaxable, and then they would get their money back from the fake business. So imagine if that $500,000 of investments from my above example was fake, and after awhile 90% of the money was given back to the business (I'm assuming the Panamian company took a cut of the money as payment).  2.6 TB of data in total, over 11 million documents and over 200,000 fake companies. According to [the website that published the news of the leak](http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/56febff0a1bb8d3c3495adf4/), they were contacted by an anonymous source with encrypted files with the data sometime in 2015. Here's am exerpt from the article:
> Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.
  
Apparently there's several trillion dollars of money that should've been taxed and wasnt. Not sure if that means trillions that should've been taxed off of, or trillions of dollars of straight tax money, but either way it's a LOT.
 
Many political leaders (many seem to be in the Middle East), and celebrities are involved as well. To prevent any one person from being blamed for the leak, hundreds of news organizations are going to release further full details tonight (that's what Ive heard, not sure how true it is) but the list apparently has thousands of people/companies on it. There's 11 million documents though, and even though hundreds of journalists have been going through the data for months, there's still information that has yet to come to light.

This goes much farther than tax evasion, and includes Syrian war crimes, human trafficking, and more. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6XnH_OnpO0)'s a video explaining it.

**TL;DR Big names in business, politics, and sports used fake companies to evade trillions of dollars worth in tax money.**"
3347, "ELI5: The Panama Papers", lucaspon, "Ok let me give this ELI5 a shot.

You guys know income taxes, right? Okay, so companies also have to pay them, but **business expenses are tax-deductible, which means that if companies spend the money they made they don't have to pay the taxes on those moneys.**

Stay with me.

Suppose you're a newly rich guy in a capitalist nation and your company has made $300m in profits. You owe about ~35% in income tax, or $105m. I know right? That's a lot of money.

Now let's assume that you're a good guy and aren't inherently evil or anything. You go to a cocktail party with some also-very-rich friends (because, you know, that's what rich people do, they flock together)
and you're talking to the ""cool kids"", trying to mingle and stuff, and you complain that you have to pay this mind-boggling huge amount of money to the gov't and how *""that sucks, right guys?""*.

**Instantly they laugh at you and go like: ""You silly, you must be new here. You're not really thinking on paying all those taxes right?** All you gotta do is spend most of that money so that your profits are close to $0, and you have to pay no income tax, *duuh*!""

Now, you can't buy things for yourself with your company's money prior to income-taxation (that's against the law) and you don't even want to spend it all at once, so you *just transfer them to another fake company in Panama and label that as ""expenses"" in your company's income tax papers.* Yes. **~~The same one your friends use.~~ Incorporated by the same law firm your friends use.**^((Mossack Fonseca)^)

If you transfer $295m to Panama Co. and declare a $5m profit, you pay only ~$1.8m in taxes, about 1% of the amount you really owe the gov't. And no one has to know that company belongs to you as well.

And voilà, with a simple combination of group-pressure and *""well-if-everyone's-doing-it-since-forever-and-nothing-has-ever-gone-wrong""* thinking you've dodged the law and effectively stole millions from the gov't and the peoples. Except that, well... things don't always repeat the past, and now they have gone **terribly wrong**. Oh shit.

Alright. But it doesn't stop here. These offshore companies in Panama aren't obliged to disclose information about the owners, sources and use of the proceeds they incorporate.

And so, they can also be used to hide money earned from/used in criminal activities such as financing terror groups and ~~prostitution~~ forced prostitution/people trafficking and pedophiles and all sorts of disturbing inhumane things.

Hope I made a decent job explaining :)

2. Have your home company bought out or transfer ownership to the new company.  

3. Operate as you have before. Taxes on income are payable to Panama. Not in say Canada. Think about it? Why would you owe taxes on income earned on a foreign country.

Many wealthy Canadians have done this. Former PM Paul Martin runs his business out of Panama. The Mcain  and Irving brothers all offshore. I'm of the opinion that you should point the first get at tax authorities before blaming the individual.

Original Comment:

> Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to increase spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can ""spend"" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.

The machinery pretty much grinds up the oranges whole, skin and all, and then extracts every drop of juice from the ground-up mess. So they get more juice per orange than we can by hand, or even really with a countertop juicer. Multiply this by the scale at which they work - truckloads of oranges at a time - and that's how it works.

Did some IT consulting at the Tropicana factory in Bradenton, FL for a while. I learned some pretty interesting things about orange juice while I was there. Also had to wash my hair 2-3 times when I came home on Fridays or I'd smell like oranges all weekend."

3361, "ELI5: How is Orange Juice economically viable when it takes me juicing about 10 oranges to have enough for a single glass of Orange Juice?", MyInquisitiveMind, "My father worked in various divisions of Tropicana for nearly 40 years, going from factory work and into corporate.  He has more knowledge about the industry than nearly anyone in the world, though he retired several years ago.

Here's what he has to say:

A standard box of oranges (as bought from a grower in Florida) weighs 90 lbs. That box when extracted by a processor will generate 5.5 to 6.0 gallons of orange juice. A typical box of oranges will supply 180 to 220 oranges ... depending on the maturity and the variety of orange. That means that it takes about 34.8 oranges to produce a gallon of OJ.

Re cost .... the economics of ""table fruit"" that you buy to eat is different than the economics of field run processed fruit. Table run fruit is sorted for appearance, boxed, and sold at a premium. Some varieties of table fruit are also processed but mostly used as table fruit and sell at a significant premium to processed fruit. Valencia, Parson Brown, ""Pineapple"" oranges and Hamlins are the main varieties of oranges used in Florida to make OJ in processing plants. Extractor do not ""grind up the fruit"". There are 2 types of extractors .... one ""reems"" the fruit like you do at home and the objective of the reem is to get all of the juice, pulp and inside of the orange without impacting the white interior of the fruit (albedo) which is very bitter. The peels and waste material are then sent to a feed mill where they are pressed to reduce liquid content and dried to make cattle feed. The pressed liquid is run through an evaporator to turn it into molasses and added back to the cattle feed to sweeten it up.

A comment in the string says ""don't let them tell you they don't add water because they do"". They don't add water to not from  concentrate Orange Juice .... it is against the law and no reputable brand would do this.
The cost of the oranges is so different because when you buy table fruit it is at most a bag .... processors sign contracts to buy whole groves of oranges .... sometimes buying millions of 90 lb boxes at a time. If you look in the commodity exchange ... you will see ""Orange Juice Concentrate Futures"". This is the price a processor is expecting to pay for a standard pound solid (about one gallon of single strength orange juice) in the future. That cost typically runs from $1.25 to $2.00 ..... for about 35 processing oranges. (See math at the top of this note)

All that is true, but it doesn't explain how OJ is economically viable. 

If one orange tree can produce X bottles of juice, and maintaining the tree + harvesting + land + all the other costs ends up being Y dollars per tree, then all you have to do is do a little math to figure out how much you can sell bottles for and come out ahead.

I think what you're really asking is how can orange juice be so cheap compared to the cost of the oranges it would take you to produce the same amount. Here you have to remember that orange growers aren't charging for oranges based on their expenses but based on *how much you'll pay for them.* If you'll pay 50 cents for an orange then they charge that. You might not want to pay a dollar. They're going to sell an amount of oranges that maximizes value. Better 1,000 oranges at 50 cents than 200 oranges at a dollar.

If we assume that selling oranges in their natural form is the most profitable way for growers to sell them, then they would sell all of them this way if possible. If they flood the market with oranges though the price will go down. At a certain point it would become cost-prohibitive. If oranges were selling for a penny a piece then everyone would go out of business (probably). So if orange growers only sell 10% of their oranges this way before it becomes inefficient, they can use the other 90% to make juice.

Making juice might only yield a profit of 1 penny per orange, while selling oranges straight up yields a nickel per orange. But it's better to make that 1 penny than flood the market with oranges and go out of business. 

TL;DR it's all about meeting demand at efficient levels for each portion of the market. Gotta do something (profitable) with all them oranges."

The oranges in your OJ are grown and juiced in Brazil and the juice is shipped to the US in large tanker boats, much bigger than would fit in your bath tub. The juice is heated and stored in a way that means it can make the slow journey by ship and even be stored for up to a year without going bad. But the flavor is taken away by the storage so the juice would taste bad. When the orange juice comes to the US the workers carefully make it taste good again by adding orange flavor that comes from oranges like orange oil and orange essence. Cheaper labor, the ability to store juice, and a process to make juice taste the same year round makes it juice cheaper.

Oranges you buy in the store need to taste good, and look pretty. This means the oranges need to be the best looking, and carefully shipped. This makes them more expensive than all the processing that goes into orange juice."

And with respect to orange sodas there's nothing that tastes quite like Sunkist (please don't insult sunkist by claiming fanta is identical). I'd say it isn't uncommon at all to have a soda taste that isn't exactly replicable."
