Ive been looking for her for years and have yet to find a hint of her online past a news article we both were in from grade 6. I hold on to hope though. I found a friend from grade 2 after searching for 6 years, so I may yet find her.\r\n\r\nEDIT since this is headed to the front page and this comment happens to be near the top and you never know, the internet is magic...\r\n\r\nKATELYN! Yes, you, the one from Colorado and Alaska. Your old friend from Canada is looking for you. Send me a PM!\r\n\r\nEDIT2 Since people keep asking how you go about finding someone and I have had one success at this  \r\n1. Start with the name. Get the first and last name. Use your yearbook, photos from eventsteams, anything from the time you two knew each other. If your friend has a hyphened last name eg James SmithJones then youre going to look for the hyphened name AND both individual names eg James SmithJones, James Smith, and James Jones. People change their names.  \r\n2. Next google. Yes, as simple as that. Google your friend and search to the nth page for anything that might be relevant. Add keywords if your friend had some defining characteristic, a physical disability, an obscure injury, some great skill, anything that might pop up.   \r\n3. Social Media. Go to every site that uses real names Facebook, G, and linkedin are good starters and search for your friend there.  \r\n4. Dont give up hope and keep searching, it could take years before you get lucky, but if you dont give up, eventually you will.  \r\n5. Good Luck.\r\n\r\nEDIT3 OMG I found her! This post made me try googling again for the first time in quite a while and I found her on Linkedin! I also found her wedding site people tighten your security on stuff like that seriously! Ive sent her a message and am hoping for the best. Ive changed my name since we were kids, so she might ignore my message, but I guess well see. Thanks everyone for inspiring me to look one more time!\r\n\r\nEDIT4 AAAHH!! First off, thanks kind stranger for the reddit gold, its my first gilding! She responded to my message, were connected on linkedin now and conversating nicely! Im so excited, its been over a decade since we last talked! Thanks reddit for being supportive. Have a scroll through the comments to see some other inspiring and amazing stories and maybe see your name listed next to someone whos searching.

For some reason my friends mom kept renting this movie for her completely unaware it was full of sex and nudity. \r\n\r\nBasically it was a thriller about this guy who was either English or American, I cant remember which, who was visiting France I think? and for whatever reason stopped at this one big house and stayed with these strangers for a bit. One of the people in the house was a hot chick and so he banged her and then a day or two later went on his way. \r\n\r\nHowever, every road he went on away from the house brought him BACK to the house, and every time he got back to the house the people wouldnt remember him.

When I was little, I had this Cinderella book, not disney and it came with a cassette so you could listen to the story when you read it. Now, before the actual narration of the story began, there was this song. I LOVE the song. Its SO pretty, and I cant remember much of the lyrics, but I can remember the melody. \r\n\r\nI have googled in every combination of the lyrics I can think of, sung that shit into Soundhound, looked on youtube, tried to find the book itself so I can buy the fucker, but NOTHING will tell me the name of the song, or who sings it. What kills me inside is that a few years ago, I FOUND THE ARTIST, but stupid fucker that I am, I didnt write it down.I have never been able to find it since.\r\n\r\nThis is as much of the lyrics as I can remember. \r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, when the world was full of magic. Once upon a time when a dream could last forever, forever. Dragons, lions and dwarfs, witches and wizards too. Beautys beast and bears ... Chorusy bit... maids to rescue witches to conquer ...

This may be what Ive been waiting for since I began lurking years and years ago.\r\nHeres what Im looking for. \r\nIts a stopmotion animation that involves a platform that looks like a chessboard floating in a grey void. \r\nIn the very middle of the chessboard is a treasure chest.  \r\nAt each corner of the chessboard and in the middle along each side is an identical figurine.  He looks sort of like Jack Skellington, although his face isnt as featured and hes wearing a nondescript trench coat.  They may have a name tag on the back with a bar code, although my mind might have added that in the years since Ive seen it. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the scene starts out with no motionsound for a very long time.  I remember almost changing the channel.  But then eventually... on of the figures looks left, looks right, then boldly walks towards the chest in the middle.\r\nThis upsets the balance on the board and the chest starts sliding.  All the other figures scramble wildly to reestablish equilibrium.  But this one jackass keeps going after the chest.  The chest is sliding around too as the board yaws and rolls.\r\nEventually there are casualties as some figures slide off the end of the board and down into the void.  \r\nSome of the other figures begin to start chasing the chest as well as opposed to simply trying to maintain the balance and it becomes a sort of battle to get the chest. \r\nThis goes on for a fairly short time considering how long I waited for something to happen and in the end, theres one victor whos managed to get all the other figures off the board.  \r\nThe problem now is that the board is balanced on a single axis with the victor at one end of the board and the chest at the other.  \r\nIf he steps towards the chest, the board will tip and the chest will fall off. \r\nSo hes stuck where he is. \r\n\r\nIts haunted me for a very long time. It seems like Ive yet to find a better example of human nature, and why its important for us to work with people rather than against them. \r\n\r\nedit wording",0.41666666,0,0.33333334,0,0.083333336,0.16666667,0,0

To get the dialog going, this is a perfectly valid tool. But as a tool for making career decisions, relationship decisions, or psychiatric assessment, no.\r\n\r\n Due to these legitimate criticisms of the MBTI and its unscientific underpinnings, the test is rarely used in clinical psychology. I did a literature search on PubMed and discovered that, interestingly, many of the published studies of its practical utility come from nursing journals. Many of the other publications pertain to relationship counseling and religious counseling. Normally, this is a red flag. When you see a topic that purports to be psychological being used in practically every professional discipline except psychology, you have very good reason to be skeptical of its actual value.\r\n\r\nFor more, heres the Skeptoid episode transcripthttpskeptoid.comepisodes4221.

From the wiki\r\n\r\nThe first Roman fire brigade of which we have any substantial history was created by Marcus Licinius Crassus. Marcus Licinius Crassus was born into a wealthy Roman family around the year 115 BC, and acquired an enormous fortune through in the words of Plutarch fire and rapine. One of his most lucrative schemes took advantage of the fact that Rome had no fire department. Crassus filled this void by creating his own brigade500 men strongwhich rushed to burning buildings at the first cry of alarm. Upon arriving at the scene, however, the fire fighters did nothing while their employer bargained over the price of their services with the distressed property owner. If Crassus could not negotiate a satisfactory price, his men simply let the structure burn to the ground, after which he offered to purchase it for a fraction of its value. Emperor Nero took the basic idea from Crassus and then built on it to form the Vigiles in AD 60 to combat fires using bucket brigades and pumps, as well as poles, hooks and even ballistae to tear down buildings in advance of the flames. The Vigiles patrolled the streets of Rome to watch for fires and served as a police force. The later brigades consisted of hundreds of men, all ready for action. When there was a fire, the men would line up to the nearest water source and pass buckets hand in hand to the fire.",0.14717038,0,0.29434076,0.07358519,0,0.38264298,0,0.10226068

At first glance it seemed like it was Marco Rubio, but I wasnt entirely sure. When he stopped flinging the books, he gathered them all into a pile, picked them up, and then started walking towards me. I took a quick glance at the top book.\r\n\r\nWhy are you reading about Obama, Mr. Rubio. Dont you hate him? I asked, still assuming that it was in fact him.\r\n\r\nHis body was facing sideways when I said that, but he stopped, slowly turned his head to face me and said We need to dispel with this fiction..once and for all\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that I noticed he was actually sweating quite a lot, with probably enough liquid to fill Guantanamo Bay. An older man then yelled out Dont worry about Marco, kid. He does this every month or so. Rubio heard the man, turned to him looking annoyed, and then slowly turned back away. There was something odd about the way he moved though, something sort of robotic. He then looked across to the other side of the library, and sprinted with the books into the young adult fiction section. Once there he began trying to cram the books into the shelves, even where there was little room. It was that day that I first checked out Donald Trumps The Art of the Deal.",0.33333334,0,0.16666667,0,0.16666667,0.33333334,0,0

I applied for a job at a local and very popular Grocery  Pizzeria. I was told I had to work an entire day for free, they called it Dressage. So I worked my ass off for a full 10 hours the following day. They wore me out. Halfway through the day a customer told the manager her child threw her car keys in the garbage. This place is so busy, that the garbage goes out constantly. So I end up going through two huge dumpsters. It was gross. And, at the very bottom, I found the customers keys. She was so happy. Then I went back to work and told them I needed to run home and change, I only lived a couple blocks away. And she said no, that they were very busy, and couldnt do without me. So I stayed, all stinky. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day we sat down to discuss whether I had the job or not. During my initial interview I was told benefits started at 30 days. Then, during our last conversation, the supervisor said she thought it was 6 months. We all agreed that they would figure it out and call me ASAP, and I never heard from them. \r\n\r\nI was told by multiple people that they could have someone follow or shadow, another staff member, but not actually do the work. I had no food handlers permit, I probably wouldnt have been covered under any type of insurance if I was injured. \r\n\r\nThe ONLY reason I didnt pursue the issue is that the woman who lost her keys slipped me 200, she said thats what she would have had to pay a locksmith to make  a new key for her house, not including all the other keys she would have to have replaced. So I came out way ahead. \r\n\r\n\r\nThat word again Dressage. I didnt know what it meant  until later and they did work me like a horse. ",0.06666667,0,0.46666667,0,0,0.4,0,0.06666667

"759","Judge rules that NFL cheerleaders are employees, not independent contractors; now eligible for backpay in class action"," cargdad","Its really a fairly standard independent contractor vs. employee issue.  We  all of us  do not want employers to pretend that employees are independent contractors.  If they do that  the person doing the work obviously can lose out, but we all are also affected.  The employers will not be following wagehour laws, paying employer side of taxes, maintaining insurance for injuries, etc.       \r\n\r\nThere are many factors that are looked at when deciding if someone is an employee or an independent contractor.  Primarily they go to whether the person doing the work has independent control over how the work is done.  Think of it as akin to a general contractor hiring out a plumber subcontractor.  The general contractor will have plans and can be specific about materials and other things concerning what needs to be done.  The general contractor and the plumber will agree on what the cost will be, and they will agree on when the work will be done, but then the plumber will left alone to actually do the work.  The general contractor will inspect and approve the work, but will not be looking over the plumber shoulder directing what the plumber is doing.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the team involved here wanted to be specific about what the cheerleaders could and could not do  how to act, what to look like, etc. . . Certainly the advice manual referenced in the article is over the top.  But, I suspect they want to be in complete control over the image.  Once the hiring person or company starts controlling all sorts of details beyond the basics  they become much more like an employer rather than someone hiring an independent contractor to do a job.  \r\n\r\nMy guess is that teams that want cheerleaders on the sideline will either simply add them to the basic payroll  its not like it will break them to pay them 20 and hour, pay payroll taxes, etc. . . , or form a company that they will then hire to provide cheerleading services, and that company then will have to follow the employment laws.\r\n\r\nWe mostly do not like companies to take advantage of people with little negotiating power.  We should like that people want to work and to be part of things like NFL football.  We should not like that when those folks are being told by the team when and what to do that they are not being treated fairly as an employee. \r\n\r\nAs an aside  the amount to be paid is only dictated by minimum wage laws and wagehour laws.  People can agree to work for the minimum wage, but it has to be paid for all hours actually worked.\r\n",0.096432015,0,0.21407908,0,0,0.68948895,0,0

But if its not, its considered rape and its punished by death. But this rape considered adultery bullshit is something you need to take somewhere else. And congrats on how you worded to title. A fine piece of art to be added to the antiislam propaganda gallery.\r\n\r\nedit I made some mistakes. I did some research and I had a couple misconceptions. The punishment for rape is not death. The punishment is 100 lashes and a year of exile for the neverbeenmarried, and stoning for the married or exmarried. Which is the same punishment for adultery, but that still doesnt support Rape is adultery claim, because there are other key differences. The victim is not punished. The 4 witnesses condition is not applied, it just has to be proven. Some scholars also said he need to pay a fine to the victim if his punishment is survivable. And one last thing, if the rape was made under the threat of a weapon like a gun or a knife, the punishment is cutting right hand and left leg or vice versa. I found that there are some academic islamic studies on rape. So if I ever educate myself some more and read any of them, I will post updates.\r\n\r\nNow since if its either adultery or rape, the punishment is still death for this mulla, since hes most likely married. Im not sure what was the defense strategy here. The only thing I can think of is that they wanted to prove it was consensual, so it would be adultery, in that case the 4 witnesses will apply, which will get this mulla off the hook.",0.037973724,0,0.5756816,0.037973724,0,0.037973724,0,0.3103972

Amins defence lawyers argued that he should be sentenced to 100 lashes and then released  but that would have meant the girl also receiving the same punishment.\r\n\r\nSo I turned to more reliable source, and read that the rapist tried to use Afghans corrupted tribal courts where sometimes depending on the corruption of the judge rape is treated as fornication instead of rape, which of course carries a lighter sentence.\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with Sharia, because under Sharia, rape is considered two crimes for the rapist. One crime has to do with fornication and the other has to do with forcing the victim. \r\n\r\nHeres what an actual jurist of sharia states\r\n\r\n If a woman is raped, she should press charges against the one who raped her. If it is proved that she was raped, then the court must apply discretionary punishment or tazir on the rapist. Such discretionary punishment may reach the death penalty, according to some schools of thought. This is based wholly on the fact that the rape is confirmed through medical tests and court procedures, without the confession of the rapist himself....As for the rape victim, no punishment is to be inflicted on her. She is to be treated with dignity and honor, and all forms of help should be given to her to gain her rights.\r\n\r\n Dr. A.Y. Sulaiman, Prof. of  Law  Sharia at Cairo Uni.\r\n\r\np.s. I think whats almost as bad as the rape itself is any culture that convinces the rape victim to feel ashamed for the crime against her or him, coz men get raped too. Some righteous Muslim scholars took the following position thats sorely needed\r\n\r\n Kamal Badr The society also has a role to play in rehabilitating the rape victim. Instead of deserting her or considering her a person non grata in the society, for the crime she has no hand in, Islam calls upon the society to rush to assist her in modifying and improving her life. We should show her the way out the pain of abuse. Thus, many Muslim scholars, led by Sheikh AlQaradawi, have maintained that young Muslim men should hasten to marry women who fall as rape victims, so as to reduce their suffering and console them",0,0,0.514592,0,0,0.038713515,0,0.44669443

Currently, as many of you may be aware, the presidential debates are largely controlled by the Republican and Democratic parties, through a private corporation called the Commission on Presidential Debates. Their name makes them seem nonpartisan and official, but they are far from it. As a result, challenging formats and popular independent candidates are often excluded from the debates, and fewer debates are held, or negotiated to be eliminated entirely. George Farah goes into some amazing and shocking history about the evolution of the debates, and the entire 25minutes of the podcast is well worth your time.\r\n\r\nOpen Debates is engaged in a campaign to inform the public, the news media and policy makers about the antidemocratic conduct of the Commission on Presidential Debates. Open Debates is also promoting the creation of an alternative presidential debate sponsor comprised of national civic leaders who are committed to maximizing voter education.\r\n\r\nI figured Id do my part and pass the message along, the mods deleted my original post here a couple of weeks ago because it was deemed offtopic.",0.16,0,0.32,0,0,0.52,0,0

"1127","The Story of Jarrett Jess and Z"," flamants","Im trying to procrastinate so here is the story all on one page and a bit easier to read  \r\n\r\nYall wanna hear a story about why me and this bitch here fell out? Its kind of long but full of suspense. So I met this white bitch at Hooters. She came in with this old ass, big ass black dude. So you know as a Hooters girl we have to talk to our customers. So I sit wit them  we get to talkin and she tells me she dances! So Im like, oh yes bitch me too! Then she tells me this hulking black man is her sugar daddy. Im like oh yes bitch my sugar daddy at home. I feel it I feel it. So we vibing over our hoeism or whatever. And we exchange numbers! And we like next time u dance hun ima come dance wit you! and they leave.\r\n\r\nSo THE NEXT DAY I get a text like BITCH LETS GO TO FLORIDA! And Im like huh?? Shes like, Im going to dance in Florida, lets go!! Now Im skeptical, like DAMN bitch we just met and we already taking hoe trips together? But I had went to Florida 2 months prior and made 15K so lowkey I was down. So I was like okay Ill go. Whos all going and when we leaving. All this bitch says is be ready by 8. So I call her like bitch I SAID whos all going! and she says my boyfriend and our roommate, and my roommate has a place in Tampa. So Im like ok ok ok. Ill be ready. So I pack my baddest stripper wear and Im ready. Now my nigga DID NOT want me to go. He was soooooo hurt so I had to fuck him calm, and then I left.\r\n\r\nNow when I got in the car it was a white boy her bf  this hulking black guy NOT the same one I met at the restaurant. So I texted her on the slick while in the backseat like another sugar daddy? U got a type bitch! and THE BLACK DUDE HAD HER DAMN PHONE!! So he starts laughing and he goes Im using her GPS. No Im not a sugar daddy Ive known her and her dude for 8 years. We all live together. So Jessica the white bitch pulls me to the side and is like we gone be at the club all night. This room for Jarrett. Not us! Dont even trip. So I was like yea bitch okay. But trust I am NOT laying my head here. So we leave our shit at the motel wit Jarrett and head to the club.\r\n\r\nSo we working. It was kind of slow it was early Friday night and the club had HELLA rules which Im not use to Ima full nyde typa bitch. But this club requires pasties and boy shorts and all this other shit...whatever. So after making about 800, I was ready to go. She was talking to some dude, tryna talk him out his wallet  they exchanged numbers. So I was like call ur man. Im ready! ...She calls the black dude. Im like ummm thats not ur man but okay. So I pull her to the side before he pulled up like wassup wit ur roommate? And she was like were really close. Before I met Jarrett I was with him. He was taking care of me. I was like OHHH well I dont need that. Taking care of me in stripper language means that he was her pimp. So I was like does Jarrett know? And she goes of course not...strike 1. So then she goes I didnt make anything tonight. What u make because hes gonna ask ...I said umm thats not yalls business Jess! ...chill.\r\n\r\nSo he pulls up and AS SOON as we get in he goes what yall make and we said at the same time nothing...so he goes damn my girl said she had a bad night too. We finna go pick her up his fiancee who lives down here. We pick her up and he goes nobody made shit. Yall wanna trap? Trap in stripper lingo means trick. So Jessica goes hell yea! U got some clients? Im in the back on mute. He was like u can get some! So Jess is like Yea I need to trap. But Jarrett is in the room! And he goes I wasnt putting yall in that shit hole that was for him not yall. Im still quiet...we pull up to a nice ass hotel on the other side of town and he goes Ill get the clients together and text yall off this...he handed her a trap phone. So I am mind blown at this point.\r\n\r\nSo then we get to the room. Nice as fuck. Just me  Jess, and I start GOIN OFF. BITCH U GOT ME FUCKED UP. IM NOT ABOUT TO PLAY WIT U HO. IM GOIN HOME so she starts cryin and shes like I didnt want to take this trip alone, please dont leave me. I would be so scared alone shes fucking sobbing. Im like ooooommmmmmggggggg really?! Now Im feeling bad for the ho. She goes u can just check the guys in, hes not gonna force u to trap. I said OH BITCH I KNOW HE NOT, I KILL DEAD ASS KILL YALL verbatim. \r\n\r\nSo she cleans herself up  theres a knock at the door...I open the door and some fat white man goes Im here for the white girl. So I check his pockets, take his wallet and let him in...they start fucking RIGHT on the bed next to me. It was a fucking mess. A MESS. So when they finished he gave her 100. I said Jess, u sellin puss for 100??? Pussy is worth thousands. U trippin. She goes I dont make the prices. The prices are already discussed before they go in. So I was like Bitch no. If u gone do this. Do it right...\r\n\r\nSo I took some pics of her  put em on backpage along with the trap phone number wit a MINIMUM of 500. The phone starts BLOWIN UP!!! I was like see bitch. I got u a nigga comin up RIGHT NOW giving 500 for 15 mins. He gomes, I check him, they get it on, he leaves. We are doing this ALL NIGHT! She fucked about 20 dudes and her sorry ass pimp only sent 3 of them So around 6 AM JARRETT CALLS.\r\n\r\nShe answers on speaker and he is going OFF!!! WHERE TF ARE U AND ZOLA?! The club BEEN CLOSED! She goes we went to another club cus it was slow. So Im googling 24h clubs Florida has a few tryna help her lie and he is NOT having it Hes LIVID. He goes if u went home wit a dude ur DEAD! So he asks to speak to ME?! I was like maaannn ima end up killin these crazy white niggas tonight. So he starts cursing ME out!!! He says Where are yall! I kno shes lying!! Dont be a ho like her, Zola! I said I PROMISE you, Im not...he hangs up on me and that was it.\r\n\r\nWe didnt hear from him for the rest of the night. We fall asleep. A few hours later the black dude I STILL DONT KNOW HIS NAME comes up. Hes like how much u make last night Jess goes 5,500 I was like, WTF WHY SHE TELLIN THE TRUTH? I pimped her NOT HIM!!! So he goes wtf how? Thats good but I only sent u 3 clients. She goes Zola made me a backpage. I was like WOOWOWOWOWOWOWOOWOW. Here we go...So he goes u can do my job better than me? I said, I was just helping her out. irdc. Ur clients were cheap. He started laughing and he goes give me the money. She gave him ALL OF IT. And he goes Thanks Zola. U a real one. and throws 500 at me... I put it in my bra. And Jess goes, what about me? And he said u owe me rent Jess. U havent paid in months. I was like damnnnn.\r\n\r\nSo we leave and head to Jarrett  the raggedy motel. Cus our shit was there. As we pull up, Jarrett chillin outside smokin weed wit some dude. PAY ATTENTION HERE! We get out and walk up to them and Jarrett goes here they go. The pimp goes HERE GO WHO LIL NIGGA, WHO DIS?! Jarrett starts laughing and was like he was asking me who I was here wit  I said my girl and her friends and thats all. Chill out. The guy Jarrett was talkin to laughs  goes Ill catch u later man. Nice meeting u. and leaves. He was a black guy wit dreads. A FL nigga. \r\n\r\nSo we all go up to the room and the pimp is going OFF on Jarrett. U dont know these niggas!! I cant believe u told him 2 bitches in here!! And Jarrett goes he asked why I was out here mad last night. All I said was my girl went to work wit her friend and I aint want her to! Now the pimp SCREAMING SO THAT NIGGA KNO ITS MONEY UP HERE NOW?! HELL NO. WE GOTTA GO!! NOW. Me and Jess are like ",0.050851766,0,0.66946346,0.025425883,0.0127129415,0.20340706,0,0.03813882

Dont just move on. Break off all contact. Dont follow them on social media, dont go to places you know she frequents in hopes youll catch a glimpse of her. Dont think about her until you even forget her name. If you see her on the street just be like oh, hey and keep walking. Excising the emotion and the obsession is the only way to maintain your sanity and dignity. Reserve that enthusiasm only for women who are truly interested in and excited about you as you are for them. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer my parents spanked me harder when I cried and I have the dead eyes of a shark.

It happened enough for him to wonder what was happening to his fishing line.\r\n\r\nHe set bait on his line, and then watched it. During the night, a raven landed by the fishing hole. With its beak, it pulled the line, with its foot, it held the line down, and repeat. The raven did this for the length of the line, and grabbed the fish from the end. It let loose and the line sunk back underwater. Then flew away with its bounty.\r\n\r\nI, personally, have spent a lot of time around ravens and they did get to know my schedule.

To clarify, I spend a good amount of free time researching this topic, as opposed to just watching Blackfish and forming an opinion from that.\r\n\r\nFirstly, SeaWorld is primarily an entertainment facility. Thats why its called SeaWorld Parks  Entertainment, not SeaWorld Rescue  Rehab. They make more than enough money to focus on rescue  rehab work, but they choose not to. Not only do they make enough profit themselves for it, but they receive government grants as well for it. So, in short  theyre rolling in the  for rescue work.\r\n\r\nObviously Im not against the rescue work, thats all well and good. Its the fact that they dont retire the orcas and they breed them over and over until they cant breed anymore see Gudrun, Corky II cases. The lifespans barely touch wild lifespans and only 2 male orcas have lived up to the wild average currently Tilikum, Ulises. How does this happen with their superior veterinary care? Why are their teeth being drilled out until theyre just left with gums if they have such high standard dental care? \r\n\r\nIdk how many people have heard about the Blue World Project where theyre planning on upgrading the orca tanks so theyre bigger and less barren. But theyve lied outright to the public there since they still dont have planning permission for that, despite saying building work would start by now!\r\n\r\nIts not just SeaWorld itself  its the support they give to other substandard facilities that own cetaceans too. They sent three young, related killer whales over to Spain on a BREEDING LOAN. That is the height of irresponsibility! The orcas have a shitty fucked up social structure because they never learned how to live together so theyre always fighting and two inbred calves have been born there that the mother rejected and one died in 2013. Not only that, but the facility itself is crap the orcas eat the paint off the walls because the park own couldnt be arsed to wait longer to fix it which means endoscope procedures for the orcas which is dangerous for the orcas and trainers involved. If SeaWorld really gives a fuck about their orcas, why are they letting this happen?? Im not on about the trainers  I get that they must care about the animals they work with  I mean the higherups making these decisions.\r\n\r\nThey also support Mundo Marino since they cant breed from Tilikum anymore since hes overrepresented in the population so they buy sperm from their orca, Kshamenk. Look him up and youll see the issue there.\r\n\r\nI could bang on all day about this but yeah. \r\n\r\ntldr SeaWorld rescue  rehab is great, good job guys. But they seriously need to make some huge changes concerning the orcas because they dun fucked up there a lot. \r\n\r\n",0,0,0.5221932,0,0.052219324,0.42558745,0,0

Thank you very much for agreeing to this AMA!\r\n\r\nFirst off I just wanted to say thank you for inspiring me and many others Im sure to take physics through to university. When I was a teenager planning what to study at university, my mother bought me a signed copy of your revised version of A Brief History of Time with your printed signature, and Leonard Mlodinows personalised one. It is to this day still one of my most prized possessions, which pushed me towards physics  although I went down the nuclear path in the end, astronomy and cosmology still holds a deep personal interest to me!\r\n\r\nMy actual question is regarding black holes. As most people are aware, once something has fallen into a black hole, it cannot be observed or interacted with again from the outside, but the information does still exist in the form of mass, charge and angular momentum. However scientific consensus now holds that black holes evaporate over time due to radiation mechanisms that you proposed back in the 70s, meaning that the information contained within a black hole could be argued to have disappeared, leading to the black hole information paradox. \r\n\r\nI was wondering what you think happens to this information once a black hole evaporates? I know that some physicists argue that the holographic principle explains how information is not lost, but unfortunately string theory is not an area of physics that I am well versed in and would appreciate your insight regarding possible explanations to this paradox!",0.33333334,0.16666667,0,0,0,0.5,0,0

However, most human behavior cannot be classified as correct or incorrect.

AMA!"," aacawareness","Dear Professor Hawking,\r\nMy name is Zoe and I am a sixteen year old living in Los Angeles.  I am a long time Girl Scout 11 years and am now venturing forth unto my Gold Award.  The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest award in girl scouting, it is equivalent to the Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts.  It teaches a lot of life skills with research, paperwork and interviews, but also with hosting workshops and reaching out to people. The project requires at least 80 hours of work, which I find less daunting then making the project leave a lasting affect which is the other big requirement of the project.  To do that, I am creating a website that will be  a lasting resource for years to come.\r\n\r\nFor my project, I am raising awareness about AAC Alternative Augmented Communication devices.  Even though I am not an AAC user, I have see the way that they can help someone who is nonverbal through the experience of my best friend since elementary school.  I want to thank you for your help already with my project, by just being such a public figure that you are, I can say. An AAC device is a computer that someone uses when they are nonverbal gets blank stares, you know like Professor Hawkings computer then they all get it  \r\n\r\nI have already presented at California State University Northridge and held a public workshop to raise awareness for AAC devices.  For my presentation, I explained what AAC devices are and how they new an option for people who are nonverbal.  They are such a new option, that many people do not know they exist.  As soon as my best friend knew that she could get an AAC device, she got one and it helped her innumerably.  Before she had it, all she had to communicate was yes and no, but when she got her device, there were so many more things for her to say.  One instance, where she was truly able to communicate was when we were working on our science fair project.  We had been researching the effects that different types of toilet paper had on the environment, and I had proposed that we write our data on a roll of toilet paper clean, to make it creative and interesting when we had to present it to the class.  Before, she would have just said no to the idea if she did not like it, but we would not know why, but with her AAC device, she was able to be an active part of the project by saying no and explaining why, she said it was gross.  That is true communication at its finest and I have heard of other similar instances like this.  \r\n\r\nBut my project is not only for the potential AAC users, I am also aiming my project toward everyone else.  I want to get rid of some of the social awkwardness that comes with using an AAC device.  It is not that people are rude on purpose, they just do not know how to interact.  One instance of this that really stood out to me had to do with the movie The Theory of Everything.  I was reading an interview with Eddie Redmayne about how he got to meet you, in the interview he said that he had researched all about you and knew that you use an AAC device, but when he finally got to meet you, he did not know how to act and kept talking while you were trying to answer.  This awkwardness was not on purpose, but awareness and education on how to interact with AAC users, would help fix this situation.  My best friend also had problems with this same issue when she went to a new school. I addressed this with my project by holding a public workshop where AAC users and non AAC users came and learned about AAC devices.  They made their own low technology AAC boards and had to use them for the rest of the workshop to communicate. We also had high technology AAC devices for them to explore and learn about.  The non AAC user participants and were able to meet real AAC users.  To me, AAC is meant to break the barrier of communication, not put up new walls because of peoples ignorance of the devices.\r\n\r\nTo quote The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, My thoughts are stars, that can not be fathomed into constellations. with an AAC Device, we were able to see just a few of those stars, and with more practice we will be able to see constellations.  With more wide spread use and knowledge of AAC devices this can happen for more people.  Thank your for taking to the time to answer everyones questions  here are my questions for you\r\n\r\n1. In what ways would you like to see AAC devices progress?\r\n\r\n2. As a user of an AAC device, what do you see as your biggest obstacle in communicating with non AAC users?\r\n\r\n3. What voice do you think in  your original voice or your AAC voice?\r\n\r\n4. What is one thing that everybody should know about AAC devices?\r\n\r\n5. What advice would you give to non AAC users talking to an AAC user?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nZoe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",0.067521945,0,0.3524646,0.067521945,0.067521945,0.4449696,0,0

AMA!"," Duffadash","Hello Professor Hawking.\r\n\r\nMy question is this How much of your fear of the potential dangers of A.I. is based around the writing of noted futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil?\r\n\r\n\r\nI just recently finished my Bachelor project on the validity of his Law of Accelerating Returns LOARhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiAccelerating_changeKurzweil.27s_The_Law_of_Accelerating_Returns, as it has not been peer reviewed but is still highly respected. I found a number of large problems with both the empiric data it was based on as well as its theoretical basis.\r\n\r\nLOAR is meant to show the unstoppable accelerating force that drives development of technology to greater and greater heights. As a basis of this, Kurzweil uses his observation that the continued exponential growth in calculating power of computershttpwww.singularity.comimageschartsMooresLaw.jpg. Even when the technology they were using were nearing the end of its life cycle and could no longer keep up, another technology simply replaced it with no major breaks in the graph. He then goes on to generalize this to be the case for all technology, even though the only other graph that shows a similar trend across different technologies is this one on RAMhttpwww.singularity.comimageschartsram.jpg.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this is that Kurzweil makes the mistake of believing that when each technology was beginning to have problems continuously experiencing growth, the appearance of a solution in the form of a replacement technology was inevitable. He then goes on to assume that this will always continue to happen. This is called retrospective determinism and is a logical fallacy.\r\n\r\nKurzweil also repeatedly states that no external force, such as politics, economy, lack of resources, technological lockin or social circumstances can have any major effect on the continued exponential growth of technology. This is very clear technological determinism, which is also problematic, as it keeps Kurzweil from being critical of his own theory.\r\n\r\nThe reason Kurzweil gives for the continued growth, despite external forces, is at least in some of his books and essays that technology is actually a continuation evolution, and is therefore a fundamental aspect of the universe a natural law. This ignores that all natural examples of exponential growth experiences diminishing returns as necessary resources become scarce. It also displays a fundamental misunderstanding of how evolution works. Kurzweil implies that technological growth is a direct continuation of human evolutionary growth. With this he is hinting that human evolution is working towards a future change. Evolution is however not a sentient, and is as such not working towards any specific endgoals, unlike Kurzweilhttpwww.singularity.comimageschartsCountdowntoSingularityLog.jpg.\r\n\r\nMuch of the empirical data is based around single sources, often websites that no longer exist. As his books have no methodology sections, the validity of the sources or how they are used is never discussed, leaving open questions of how you get a number for calculations per second per 1000httpwww.singularity.comchartspage70.html for something that was never built like the Charles Babbage Analytical Engine.\r\n\r\nIn general, Kurzweils writing on the future has the effect of readers that when it touches upon their area of expertise it is obviously completely wrong, but the rest seems quite reasonable. I, myself am not an expert in artifical intelligence research, but Kurzweil is, so I could not hope to know whether his writing on that subject is more valid than his books on the singularity, but I assume so. Just be aware that years of living from innovation might have made Kurzweil too uncritical of his own theories.",0.15690377,0,0.5292887,0.052301258,0,0.2615063,0,0

The papers abstract reads as following\r\n\r\n The matter of friendly AI theory has so far almost exclusively been examined from a perspective of careful design while emergent phenomena in super intelligent machines have been interpreted as either harmful or outright dystopian. The argument developed in this paper highlights that the concept of friendly AI is either a tautology or an oxymoron depending on whether one assumes a morally real universe or not. Assuming the former, more intelligent agents would by definition be more ethical since they would ever more deeply uncover ethical truths through reason and act in accordance with them while assuming the latter, reasoning about matters of right and wrong would be impossible since the very foundation of morality and therefore AI friendliness would be illogical. Based on evolutionary philosophy, this paper develops an in depth argument that supports the moral realist perspective and not only demonstrates its application to friendly AI theory  irrespective of an AIs original utility function  making AGI inherently safe, but also its suitability as a foundation for a transhuman philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe only reason to worry about transhumanly intelligent machines would be if one believed that matters of right and wrong are arbitrary constructs. A position very popular in post modern academic circles. Holding such a believe however would make advocating for one particular moral stance over another fundamentally untenable as one would have no rational ground to stand on from which to reason from in its favor.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for taking your time to do this important AMA and looking forward to your comments.",0.18788163,0,0.060591824,0,0,0.75152653,0,0

Instead we should see AI as the next stage in humanity  a collective technological offspring so to speak.  Whether our biological offspring or technological offspring go on, should not matter to us.\r\n\r\nIndeed, worrying about AI replacing us is analogous albeit to a lesser extent to worries about genetic engineering or bionic organ replacement.  Many people have made the argument that playing God in these respects is unnatural and should not be allowed and this feels like an extension of that.\r\n\r\nSome of my colleagues have published a few papers showing that humans trust technology more when its anthropomorphized or that we see things as unnatural as immoral. The worry about AI seems to be a product of this innate tendency to fear things that arent natural. \r\n\r\nUltimately, Im wondering what youre thoughts are about this?  Are we simply being irrationally tied to our human form? Or is there a specific reason why AI replacing us would be detrimental unless you are also predicting a terminator style genocide",0.30769232,0,0.50769234,0.06153846,0,0.12307692,0,0

However, I believe you would be one of the most well suited individuals to answer.\r\n\r\nRegarding black holes... It is generally accepted that as matter or you and I on our spaceship approaches a black hole, time dilation and spaghettification takes place, and that it is a generally unpleasant and violent experience. It makes sense to me that upon approaching a massive body like a star or gas giant, that destruction would be something perceived and experienced by the matterpeople approaching, as the object and its gravitational pull and pressure are an understandable force, and time dilation would not slow to the point it would near a singularity. What I find difficult to wrap my head around is how we, if we were to approach an event horizon, would perceive these events, or if we ever would at all. All objects of mass create a dip in the fabric of spacetime, though in the case of a black hole it is my understanding that the fabric of spacetime is being warped and stretched to a point that is hardly conceivable for me, anyway, the singularity being infinitely massive. Assuming, miraculously, there was no other matter immediately adjacent and jostling us for position which would of course result in our destruction would we on our approach even perceive this stretching and change in timeflow? To the outside, I would assume it would look like a very quick and violent demise, but I wonder that to the person going for the ride, so to speak, it would simply be a neverending trip to oblivion.\r\n\r\nA less rambling version when approaching a black hole, considering the bizarre effects on time and space, would one be able to perceive the change in time flow and the stretching of spacetime around them as they themselves are in it? Could spaghettification take place without the person even realizing they are being spaghettified?\r\n\r\nIf that even is a possibility, as a followup, is it possible that objects, as they approach very near or actually enter the singularity, could continue on as though nothing has happened, since again, it is the space itself that has been bent and pulled out from underneath us?

"1819","Researchers have developed a blood test that can accurately diagnose, from a single drop of blood, if a person has cancer, with 96% certainty for most cancer types"," dblowe","This is going to sound counterintuitive, but 96 accuracy is not good enough.\r\n\r\nThe reason is the prevalence rate of various cancers. When you read the paper, which is open access, you find in Figure 4 that the false positive rate telling someone that they have cancer, when they dont was 3 in lung cancer, 4 in brain cancer, and 4 in liver cancer. The false negative rate, telling someone theyre fine when they actually have cancer, was 2, 5, and 1, respectively.\r\n\r\nThat may sound pretty good. But you have to look at the prevalence rates of these cancers  how many people actually have them. The NIH estimates that there were about 409,000 people living with lung cancer in 2010, for example httpseer.cancer.govstatfactshtmllungb.html out of a total adult population of 241 million. Thats a prevalence rate of 0.17.  So if you test 100,000 adults, youd expect roughly 170 of them to actually have lung cancer. But this test will tell 3,000 of them who dont have cancer that they do  in other words, youve overdiagnosed lung cancer by a factor of more than 17 times over the real rate. Thats completely unacceptable. Meanwhile, of those 170 or so that really did have cancer, youve told three or four of them that theyre actually fine. And thats not good, but it pales in comparison to the false positive problem.\r\n\r\nYou can see that if you require all 100,000 to take the test again, things just get more confusing. Now there are another 3,000 or so false positives, and all youve done is make the signalnoise even worse. That would be a very bad idea, so what if you just take everyone who tested positive and have them do a retake? The 3,000 of those who tested falsely positive will give you about 90 false positives again. So now you have 2,910 people from this group who have one up, one down on their two tests, and you have ninety people who still dont have lung cancer, but who have been told twice in a row now that they do.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that there are really only about 170 people who actually do have lung cancer. The 167 of them who really did get a positive diagnosis are going to get tested again, too, if were retesting everyone who came up positive the first time we dont know whos a false positive and whos a real one. Of those X, were going to tell three of them this time that they dont actually have cancer that 2 false negative rate. The others are now in the twopositivetest camp, so the total breakdown is this after one round of testing, and another round for those who tested positive\r\n\r\n100,000 people tested.\r\n164 who really have cancer and who learned about it from this test, and have tested positive twice in a row.\r\n90 people who dont have cancer at all but who have also tested positive twice in a row.\r\n2,913 who have had one positive test and one negative one, and who have no idea what to do next\r\n3 who really have cancer, but have been told that theyre fine.\r\n\r\nNote that this means that if you test positive twice in a row, it means that your odds of actually having lung cancer are still only 65 164  of the twiceinarows really do, 90 dont. You wouldnt imagine that this would be possible, running a 96 accurate test twice in a row, but thats exactly how it works.\r\n\r\nAnd lung cancer has a reasonably high prevalence rate. For the cancers with fewer people out in the population, the numbers can be much worse depending on the false positive rate, but that seems to be around 3 or 4  in general. In general, a test like this has a possibility of being useful  in a sense of sending people to do some other sort of test, if there is one. But for lung cancer, that might well be an Xray, and weve now irradiated thousands of people who didnt need to be. \r\n\r\nA good diagnostic test for cancer is an excellent thing, perhaps the best thing weve got to fight the disease. But theyre hard to find, and we dont have nearly enough of them.",0.15514183,0,0.42375886,0,0,0.42109928,0,0

They then trained an SVM to decide if a sample was cancer or noncancer based on what RNA sequences were present or absent in the sample. They then validated on a separate dataset.\r\n\r\nThe putative mechanism for the test is that platelet cells in the blood have their RNA composition changed by being in close proximity to the cancer microenvironment as they circulate through the blood. The authors call this tumor education and suggest it may be due to the platelets picking up chemicals secreted by tumors as they pass by along with a few other possibilities.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly an interesting result, but it is a very preliminary study with small N 55 healthy, 228 CA and a relatively small number of cancer types.\r\n\r\nThe results on the validation set for CANo CA were\r\nSensitivity of 97\r\nSpecificity of 94\r\nIt should be noted that these are not really the most important numbers, which are actually the PPV and the NPV. These statistics, however, are heavily dependent on the characteristics of the population to be tested.\r\n\r\nFor comparison, the sensitivity and specificity of the PSA are approximately 21 and 91. The sensitivity and specificity of mammography are approximately 68 and 75. These numbers are huge simplifications, but useful for comparison.\r\n\r\nMy overall feeling is that this is quite a promising avenue of research, and that we will soon see largerscale trials. If they pan out, then it is likely that this test will find clinical use. Even if largescale trials yield worse numbers, there still could be utility as a screening tool, especially if only applied in selected highprevalence populations. So, definitely there is reason for excitement, but dont expect to be going to your doctor tomorrow and getting this cancer test. Years of testing and validation will be required before we can trust that this test actually works well. \r\n\r\nI realize some may feel that this is due to the community wanting to hide a promising test, but the truth is that it is important to validate tests before we use them because otherwise a bad test may lead to unnecessary morbidity, both psychological i.e. telling someone who doesnt have cancer that they have cancer and physical unnecessary testing and associated exposure to radiation andor surgeries.",0.16313213,0,0.2446982,0.16313213,0.081566066,0.34747148,0,0

"1907","Twitter has forced 30 websites that archive politician's deleted tweets to shut down, removing an effective tool to keep politicians honest"," ndobie","I am sure this is going to be buried but I want to offer my knowledge of having worked with Twitters and other social networks APIs and have read those boring Terms of Service rules.\r\n\r\nFirst off APIs provide an official backdoor for third parties to obtain information from a site about you, most of these are heavily regulated and generally require your authorization in order to obtain that information. Some sites, like Twitter, make all their public activities, in this case tweets, available without authorization. \r\n\r\nHowever under the terms of service in using Twitters, and most others, when an application using the API is notified that an item was deleted they must also remove it from their system.This is where these sites got into trouble and the internal debate at Twitter took place. Under the terms this means that when a politician deleted a tweet, these site must also remove the tweet, which they dont because their whole purpose is to prevent this for politicians.\r\n\r\nThis rule requiring applications to delete tweets is blanket and applies to all Twitter accounts including yours. The spirit of this rule is to try and prevent that tweet you mistakenly made from being stuck out there and you can never take it back. So the debate at Twitter was, should this rule exclude politicians? And judging by the result it was no. With this decision these archiving sites were in violation of Twitters terms of service, so their API access was revoked and were most likely sent DMCA requests to remove what tweets they had already copied since all tweets are technically copyrighted by Twitter thus shutting down the sites.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you agree with Twitters decision to not classify politicians accounts as exclusions to the deletion rule, Twitters goal is to protect its users right to privacy.\r\n\r\nOn a side note I have seen people mention that these sites could switch to web crawling to obtain these tweets. The answer is no they could not, probably. This comes back to tweets being copyrighted materials of Twitter, meaning they could make the case that by archiving the tweets without Twitters permission they are violating the DMCA. Although the sites could argue that they are using the tweets in a review or editorial fashion thus excluding them from the DMCA. It would be an issue settled in court and who knows who would win.",0.25,0,0.625,0,0,0.125,0,0

This will be a huge hit for several large figures in world sports, politics and economy. Names like Lionel messi, Vladimir Putin and the prime minister of Iceland are already leaked. I am curious to see who turns up as well. What a leak!! All coordinated by German newspaper namely the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. As op linked to\r\n\r\nBefore reading further \r\nHere is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by uJaredlong\r\n\r\nTaxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didnt pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by reinvesting in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can spend that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.\r\n\r\npls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasonsscenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons! thanks uToppo orig. commenthttpswww.reddit.comrworldnewscomments4d75i726_terabyte_leak_of_panamanian_shell_company_datad1og7kz\r\n\r\nEdit Die Zeit another big German newspaper writes that about 200k  letterbox companies in total 11.5 million records are disclosed...

The thugs tied up the security guards, doused them in gasoline, lit a match and threatened to set them afire unless they opened the warehouses vault. Inside, the thieves found nearly 7,000 gold bars, diamonds and cash.\r\n\r\nThanks ever so much for your help. Have a nice Christmas, one of the crooks said as they departed.\r\n\r\nBritish media dubbed the heist the Crime of the Century. Much of the loot  including the cash reaped by melting the gold and selling it  was never recovered. Where the missing money went is a mystery that continues to fascinate students of Englands underworld.\r\n\r\nNow documents within Mossack Fonsecas files reveal that the law firm and its cofounder, Jrgen Mossack, may have helped the conspirators keep the spoils out of the hands of authorities by protecting a company tied to Gordon Parry, a London wheelerdealer who laundered money for the BrinksMat plotters.\r\n\r\n On Feb. 10, 2011, an anonymous company in the British Virgin Islands named Sandalwood Continental Ltd. loaned 200 million to an equally shadowy firm based in Cyprus called Horwich Trading Ltd.\r\n\r\nThe following day, Sandalwood assigned the rights to collect payments on the loan  including interest  to Ove Financial Corp., a mysterious company in the British Virgin Islands.\r\n\r\nFor those rights, Ove paid 1.\r\n\r\nBut the money trail didnt end there.\r\n\r\nThe same day, Ove reassigned its rights to collect on the loan to a Panama company called International Media Overseas.\r\n\r\nIt too paid 1.\r\n\r\nIn the space of 24 hours the loan had, on paper, traversed three countries, two banks and four companies, making the money all but untraceable in the process.\r\n\r\nFamily members of at least eight current or former members of Chinas Politburo Standing Committee, the countrys main ruling body, have offshore companies arranged though Mossack Fonseca. They include President Xis brotherinlaw, who set up two British Virgin Islands companies in 2009.\r\n\r\nThe leaked files show the firm regularly offered to backdate documents to help its clients gain advantage in their financial affairs. It was so common that in 2007 an email exchange shows firm employees talking about establishing a price structure  clients would pay 8.75 for each month farther back in time that a corporate document would be backdated.\r\n\r\nThe worlds best soccer player, Lionel Messi, is also found in the documents. The records show Messi and his father were owners of a Panama company Mega Star Enterprises Inc. This adds a new name to the list of shell companies known to be linked to Messi. His offshore dealings are currently the target of a tax evasion case in Spain.\r\n\r\n",0,0,0.3675334,0.07027407,0,0.56219256,0,0

I have eagerly awaited your AMA  thank you for doing it!\r\n\r\nFirst, please allow me to say thank you. At a young and critical age when I had very few positive male role models in my life, you beautifully rendered in Captain Picard a powerful but temperate man worthy of emulation externally rational but internally passionate, proud but grounded, diplomatic but resolute, shrewd but decisive. Your work as Picard as an immensely positive presence, and I believe seeing him as an alternative helped me break more fully away from the influence of an angry, embittered, abusive father. As I learned ever more about your childhood experiences and your positions on domestic violence and PTSD, I saw that the good man onscreen was occupied by a good man offscreen. So, at length thank you.\r\n\r\nMy question\r\n\r\nWhats your favorite story about a Next Generation costar behindthescenes that we may not know about?\r\n\r\nP.S. You also helped me go bald with grace.\r\n\r\nEDIT Came back from a day of meetings to dozens of great comments  thanks everyone!

Id go out there and sit when I wanted to get away from family and make things. When my dad died, we moved away. When I came back, I was talking to some of my old school friends. They tried catching me up on the last eight years. During the talk, I learned that they didnt know whod built this little straw shack in the woods, but theyd been using as a hunting hut for about seven years till loggers came in and logged the woods, destroying it. \r\n\r\nHearing that they got seven years out of something I built in my spare time made me feel good about myself. The thatch was time consuming though. The field I got the sage grass from was half a mile from the hut. I used to got out there and reap it with the butcher knife, tie it into bundles, then lug eight bundles at a time back to the hut.

Her cancer was so bad that tumors made it impossible for her to walk and she was in the hospital permanently when he came through. She left the hospital to see the show and she was the only person he let backstage. She was ecstatic. She immediately went back to the sterile cold hospital to deal with real life again... and the very next day he shows up unannounced to bring a little bit of happiness to her.\r\n\r\nI hope he got all the support that he gave. Its not easy being around sick people, and he didnt have to. The world needs more people like him.\r\n\r\n ",0,0.11876485,0.28741094,0,0.11876485,0.4750594,0,0

My dad said that David was the nicest guy, he would entrust my dad with loads of personal secrets and talk to him like he was a mate. My dad wasnt keen on his wife though, apparently she used to click her fingers at him and call him chauffeur rather than his name. There is one story that always sticks out for me, one night David gave my dad a call and said he wanted to go for a drive, so my dad picked him up and david directed him to a warehouse, he asked my dad to come in with him. My dad walked in with him only to find out the warehouse was empty, David asked my dad to get to the other end and the played frisbee for about 2 hours in this massive warehouse.\r\n\r\nMy dad was genuinely upset this morning after hearing the news.

"2710","David Bowie dies, age 69."," WhateverYeaOk","From the article\r\n \r\nDavid Bowie has died after a battle with cancer, his rep confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. \r\n\r\nDavid Bowie died peacefully today surrounded by his family after a courageous 18 month battle with cancer. While many of you will share in this loss, we ask that you respect the familys privacy during their time of grief, read a statement posted on the artists official social media accounts. \r\n\r\nThe influential singersongwriter and producer, who dabbled in glam rock, art rock, soul, hard rock, dance pop, punk and electronica during his eclectic 40plusyear career, died after a battle with cancer. \r\n\r\nBowies artistic breakthrough came with 1972s The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, an album that fostered the notion of rock star as space alien. Fusing British mod with Japanese kabuki styles and rock with theater, Bowie created the flamboyant, androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust.\r\n\r\nThree years later, Bowie achieved his first major American crossover success with the No. 1 single Fame off the Top 10 album Young Americans, then followed with the 1976 avantgarde artrock LP Station to Station, which made it to No. 3 on the charts and featured Top 10 hit Golden Years.\r\n\r\nOther memorable songs included 1983s Lets Dance  his only other No. 1 U.S. hit  Space Oddity, Heroes, Changes, Under Pressure, China Girl, Modern Love, Rebel, Rebel, All the Young Dudes, Panic in Detroit, Fashion, Life on Mars Suffragette City and a 1977 Christmas medley with Bing Crosby.\r\n\r\nWith his differentcolored eyes the result of a schoolyard fight and needlelike frame, Bowie was a natural to segue from music into curious movie roles, and he starred as an alien seeking help for his dying planet in Nicolas Roegs surreal The Man Who Fell to Earth 1976. Critics later applauded his threemonth Broadway stint as the misshapen lead in 1980s The Elephant Man.",0,0.06747638,0.17206477,0.06747638,0.06747638,0.6255061,0,0

Michaels let his writers know the next day and they came up with an idea which Bowie initially approved of. The gist was that I was somehow roped into a low budget telly advert for a Brooklyn bakery. They wanted me to sing about their pastries or what have you. One of the things they came up with was a version of my song, Watch That Man. But instead, in the chorus I would sing, Try our flan. Bowie took issue with the way the writers wanted him to pronounce the word flan. While either of the two main pronunciations is generally accepted, the veteran rock star and food connoisseur was miffed at saying it the wrong way.\r\n\r\nDavid is a man of the world, said Michaels.\r\n\r\nHes seen it all. And he takes food very seriously. I get that. But when you are running a big, live production like we are, last second changes can be complicated.\r\n\r\nWhile Bowie expressed misgivings throughout the week, he eventually agreed to do the sketch as written. But as the show was being broadcast live he changed his mind. He backed out after his first musical performance and the sketch had to be scrapped and replaced.\r\n\r\nLategame changes are nothing new to Saturday Night Live. The show is more than prepared to handle sudden disruptions. And although Bowies late decision to bow out of the sketch did anger Michaels, it was not what ultimately got him the boot.\r\n\r\nI was scheduled to perform a single from my Earthling album called Telling Lies. Just before the band took the stage I decided to take the piss out of Lorne a bit because I knew he wasnt happy with me.\r\n\r\nWhat happened next may have looked completely innocuous to the viewing public, but it was a deliberate statement that cut one man to his core.\r\n\r\nInstead of the new single, the band played 1981s Scary Monsters and Super Creeps, a song that Michaels confessed to Bowie in private was absolutely terrifying to him.\r\n\r\nWe got to talking about this and that at dinner one night and Lornes SNL hiatus in the early 80s came up. He told me how it was the darkest period of his life and he described how much cocaine he did while listening to my Scary Monsters album. Just mountains and mountains of the stuff. Sometimes straight off the record sleeve. Those were his words. I want that to be clear about that.\r\n\r\nWhen the song was over, Bowie was immediately escorted from the studio\r\n\r\nhttpkimgordonsrealage.tumblr.compost28567497608davidbowiediscusseshisbriefbanfromsaturday\r\n\r\nGets me every time.\r\n\r\nRIP the Dame.\r\n\r\nYour music lives on\r\n",0,0,0.65065503,0.1746725,0,0.1746725,0,0

Thats how I ended up with this gash in my right ring finger.\r\n\r\n6 years ago a kitten came out of the woods and my dad, on his way to my mothers house they had divorced picked him up. My mother started nursing him back to health, and gave him to my little brother.\r\n\r\nMy little brother was living with me at the time. He fed the kitten poptarts and was upset about the kittens lack of bladder control. He said, and I quote, I opened up a 2 pack of pop tarts and started eating one and feeding him the other, I like to nibble on it and I was breaking him off chunks of the other one I was going to eat next. Then, I finished mine and realized he had finished his too. AND HE PEED ALL OVER THE PLACE, ALL ON MY BED AND MY SHIRT I DONT KNOW WHATS WrONG WITH HIM.\r\n\r\nThis happened at least three times that he told me of. Apparently, he thought that cats were predators who stalked artificial strawberry goo wrapped in chalkbread. I have always had a cat allergy and didnt like cats, so I didnt bother correcting him.\r\nAnywho, one day he left out of town to visit his girlfriend and wanted me to baby sit the kittencat.\r\n\r\nAnd here we are, 6 fuckin years later, and Ive still got him, and he bites, and scratches, and seems to have some undiagnosed Vietnamwar syndrome from time to time.\r\n\r\nBut hes my favorite friend. And he scratched the fuck out of my finger, probably because my Ima name him Georgehttpswww.bing.comvideossearch?qgeorgelovehimandhughimandsqueezehimforeverFORMVIRE4viewdetailmid99A6898CD841753C731C99A6898CD841753C731C joke when I find him burrowed in my clothes got a little too old and redundant for his tastes.\r\n\r\nCant say I blame him.

He ended up at a farm that was known for their border collies.  The farmer asked, Do you want to see one at work bringing the sheep home for the evening?  The guy says sure, and he selects a collie, gives her a command, and she goes running full blast up the mountainhill outside of his house.\r\n\r\nThen the farmer says, Okay, its cold out, lets go inside for some tea and watch her work.   They actually went inside and sat at the window while the collie gathered all the sheep constantly checking behind to make sure none were left behind, drove them down the mountain and to the farm.  Then the farmer put on his jacket, went outside and opened the fence to the barn area to bring the sheep in and said, Good girl.  Job done in 30 minutes with ONE command.\r\n\r\nI was stunned.

They have the ability to rip you limb from limb and have you for dinner. The man in this video is named Eduardo and he is the president of Black Jaguar White Tiger BJWT Foundation in Mexico. His foundation rescues animals from captivity and neglect often from the same circuses where you would go to watch them perform. His organization has gained over 3 million followers on instagram now, and he has been doing a phenomenal job with providing luxurious habitat for them to spend their time in versus the cages they are kept in all day at the circus. As cuddly and incredibly friendly as they may seem, they are extremely dangerous even as juvenilles if you do not have and sometimes even when you do have a great understanding of their behavioral patterns which vary from one individual to the next just like us humans. Just like Eddy would say A lion is a lion is a lion.\r\n\r\nSo please, if you are considering keeping a big cat as a pet, understand that they cant live in your apartment or even house without something going wrong eventually. In the case of big cats something going wrong could just be them being in an off mood or them being picky over something you did. Their behavior towards being moody varies but their is always a chance of the situation becoming deadly or lead to the cat causing immense bodily harm. These animals should be treated with respect at all times and if you wish to ignore my warnings then so be it, but at the very least make a wild cat sanctuary or build a large enclosure on your property to devote to the animal if not for your sake then for the animals well being.

First, you make massive investments in your health care infrastructure, such that physical and mental disabilities are dealt with promptly and at no cost by competent medical professionals.

Then, you throw shittons of money at vocational and professional training, job placement services, free staterun childcare programs, inter and intracity transportation systems, social welfare programs, and drug and alcohol counseling. And, of course, since homelessness springs from not being able to afford a home, you make sure that there are enough safe and comfortable living spaces for everyone to live in with dignity, regardless of their financial means.\r\n\r\nUSA Fascinating!

In court documents from the case unsealed in late 2013, all information that could identify the customer was redacted.\r\n\r\nBut federal authorities recently screwed up and revealed the secret themselves when they published a cache of case documents but failed to redact one identifying piece of information about the target his email address, Ed_Snowdenlavabit.com. With that, the very authorities holding the threat of jail time over Levisons head if he said anything have confirmed what everyone had long ago presumed that the target account was Snowdens.\r\n\r\nDocument from the Lavabit case mistakenly made public by the government showing Edward Snowdens email address was the target of the 2013 investigation.Click to Open Overlay Gallery\r\nDocument from the Lavabit case mistakenly made public by the government showing Edward Snowdens email address was the target of the 2013 investigation.\r\nThe documents were posted on March 4 to the federal court system known as Pacer as part of Levisons long battle for transparency in the case that ruined his business. They were spotted this week by the transparency site Cryptome and published online.\r\n\r\nHeres a quick recap of that case On June 28, 2013, shortly after newspapers published the first NSA leaks from Snowden, FBI agents showed up at Levisons door in Texas and served him with a pen register order requiring him to give the government metadata for the email activity of one customers account.\r\n\r\nThe case was initially sealed and the public didnt learn about it and the fight over Levisons customer until after he had shuttered his email service in defiance of the government. But even after he closed Lavabit and there was no hope of the government obtaining information about the account that it had been seeking, the target was never identified. When some of the documents in the case were finally unsealed in redacted form in October 2013, however, the unredacted parts left little doubt that the Lavabit case was about Snowden, who was known to be using a Lavabit account in the spring of 2013 when his first NSA leaks were published and when he was hiding in a safe house in Hong Kong. It was still an educated guess, however.\r\n\r\nCut to now. With the Lavabit case long ended, Levison has kept fighting to get more of the documents unsealed and unredacted. Hes been using money raised by supporters back in 2013 to fund the fight for transparency. He filed a motion in December asking an appeals court to unseal documents and vacate a nondisclosure order that has silenced him about the target. It turns out he was a little more successful in that latter request than he thought he waswith a little help from a government error. After a hearing earlier this year, a court denied his motion to unseal and vacate but ordered US attorneys in the case to rerelease all previously filed pleadings, transcripts, and orders with everything unredacted except the identity of the subscriber and the subscribers email address. After some negotiation, the government got the court to agree to let it redact other information as well that might harm its investigation into the target.\r\n\r\nThen the government messed up. When the documents were reposted to Pacer this month, Snowdens Lavabit email address was left unredacted in plain sight in an August 2013 document.\r\n\r\nWhen asked for comment, Levisons lawyer Jesse Binnall told WIRED in an email that due to the letter and spirit of the courts January 7, 2016 order, Lavabit has no further comment on the unredacted email address.\r\n\r\nBinnall is referencing the January 2016 order in which the court denied Levisons motion to unseal records and vacate the nondisclosure order in the case.\r\n\r\nWIRED spoke with Levison, prior to his learning that the government had made the redaction error, about his struggle to obtain transparency. Three years later, I still cannot tell you who they were after. I keep getting asked the question, and I cant answer.\r\n\r\nNow, it appears he doesnt have to. The government has answered for him.

While research and education are both vital, thousands of victims of breast cancer each year need not only information and the hope for an eventual cure, but also require direct assistance today so that they and their families can meet the challenges of this disease.\r\n\r\nAnd so, I created an organization dedicated to providing direct assistance, supplies and referral services to those battling breast cancer. I am especially proud to have created The Hope Supply Program, which has allowed us to partner with retailers and manufacturers to provide personal care supplies and muchneeded items wigs, prosthetic breast inserts, and postmastectomy bras, for example for patients and their families free of charge.\r\n\r\nCharities  including some of the worlds bestknown and reputable organizations  are increasingly facing the scrutiny of government regulators in the U.S. The Breast Cancer Society TBCS is no exception. Unfortunately, as our operations expanded  all with the goal of serving more patients  the threat of litigation from our government increased as well.\r\n\r\nWhile the organization, its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrong doing, and the government has not proven otherwise, our Board of Directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve, and those who remain in need, for us to engage in a highly publicized, expensive, and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices.\r\n\r\nThe silver lining in all of this is that the organization has the ability to continue operating our most valued and popular program, the Hope Supply. Our Board will work tirelessly to maintain the Hope Supply program services that have benefitted our many patients for years  initially under the TBCS banner as it transitions under a different organization  all with the goal of seamlessly providing services to you. I take solace in the fact that this wonderful program has the chance to continue operating.\r\n\r\nI have loved leading TBCS and being part of a team that engaged heart and soul in helping to serve the mission of the charity selflessly, tirelessly, and honorably.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of TBCS, I want to thank you for allowing us to be a part of your lives. It is my hope that you will continue to find the resources and assistance you need through the soontobe revamped Hope Supply Program.\r\n\r\nGiving back to the community is a mission that drives me.

The gorilla puffed its chest up and ran over to the goose, which obviously lost its shit at the sight of this big ass beast coming after it. I thought I was about to witness some shit straight out of the movie Congo, like this gorilla was going to rip the gooses head clean off. The goose pressed up to the glass, flapping and honking its head off. At the last second the gorilla just stopped short, paused, and turned back the other way like nothing had happened. It was seriously terrifying. ",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

It had a name had a great bond together just like a pet dog. Whenever she came back from school, it would cluck and run to greet her. My mom loved this chicken and it loved her. One day, one of its leg got bad and it could barely walk. My mom knew what was at stake and refused to go to school to look after this chicken. Of course my grandma had to force her to go and she eventually had to go to school. She came back as soon as she could only to find it deep fried on the dinner table.

However, even though youre buddies with Fat Albert, hes just so huge that when he gets near enough something to eat, he swallows it wrapper and all.

This is a big problem in physics because energymatterinformation cant be destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhat Hawking is saying now is that the information isnt destroyed, but instead sort of imprinted on the event horizon of a black hole.\r\n\r\nAn event horizon is what we might consider the border of inside vs outside the black hole. Everything past that line is inside the black hole and cant be seen because even light gets trapped in it. But if an object or particle enters a stable orbit on that boundary, special things happen that I dont understand and cant really describe.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can say that what Hawking is saying is that if something crosses this barrier, it effects how the event horizon looks, and therefore in a way, we can retrieve that information, kind of like looking at footprints in the snow leading up to the edge of a cliff.\r\n\r\nI may be way off base here, but thats my understanding and I invite anyone with a better understanding to ELI5 to me.\r\n\r\nEdit there is no stable orbit on the event horizon.",0.48465267,0,0.19224556,0,0,0.1615509,0,0.1615509

Its been know for a while now that black holes conserve information of in falling matter. See previous example of Albert and Simon eating junk food  anything that goes into a black hole is gone forever.... Kind of. The metaphor I like best is to think of an encyclopedia and all the knowledge it contains. Throwing it into a black hole is like throwing it into a furnace... Out of the furnace comes a big pile of ashes from the encyclopedia that, in theory, could be reconstructed atom by atom to be an encyclopedia again. In practice however, this is beyond difficult. \r\n\r\nThis argument called holographyh has held up really well! But... it was found to violate one of three unbreakable laws of quantum physics! A well known proposed solution to this conflict is the hypothetical black hole firewall that argues the encyclopedia never makes it into the center of the furnace, it just incinerates at the furnaces entrance the event horizon. \r\n\r\nYesterday, Hawking proposed his own solution that hes been working on with Andy Strominger. He argues that the information from the encyclopedia is conserved because the ashes are a super translation of the original encyclopedia.  So, what the hell is a super translation? In group algebra translations are simply how one group moves along some defined dimension  stand 3 meters from the wall. Now walk to the wall. Congratulations! You have just translated along a single dimension of space. \r\n\r\nA super translation is much more technically sophisticated than that, but its the same basic principle. It has symmetry  and thats very important. Symmetry means you can walk towards the wall, or the wall can move to you. Makes no diff. Hawking argues that the ashes are super translations of the information content of the in falling encyclopedia. Because of symmetries inherent to that mathematical object, using a super translation approach may resolve the nasty paradoxes. \r\n\r\nTldr read in Hawkings voice our calculations about black holes suck.

"3293","ELI5: Stephen Hawking's new theory on black holes"," zeidrich","I hate the top voted Fat Albert answer because its confusing and misleading.  That answer implies that you can get useful information from the leftovers, which isnt true. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that for our universe to exist the way we expect it to, we need there to be conservation of something.  At first we just thought it was conservation of mass.  \r\n\r\nBasically, if you had 1kg of something, later youre still going to still have 1kg of something, and to get it you can put together 2 things that are 500g. Those things arent going to change.   Youre not going to have a closed system where the 500g thing becomes 700g without some outside interference, and youre not going to have 1kg which becomes 800g without sending that mass somewhere.\r\n\r\nIf those things could happen, our whole universe would be weird and unstable and wouldnt work the way we observe it to.\r\n\r\nSo the next thing that we realized was a little more about the nature of matter and of relativity.  Essentially that mass and energy are essentially the same things.  So that leads to understanding things like processes that convert mass to energy like radiation or nuclear fission.  So it means that mass isnt necessarily conserved, but the combination of mass and energy is. As we learned more, we started the find more ways that energy is kind of kept in stuff.  Its more than just the kind of energy that we think about that pushes things around, its also responsible for properties of everything.\r\n\r\nI mean, if you have something like fission and one atom can turn into two different atoms, plus a lot of energy, theres more than just the mass of those atoms and the energy, theres also the fact that they ARE those atoms and those photons, and not some other configuration.  We also know for it to change between one configuration and another might take or release energy from the system, so theres actually energy IN that configuration. \r\n\r\nSo what we decided was that hey, weve said that mass is energy, and energy is energy, and something is configured in such a way that some of this stuff stays stuck together, and some of has no rest mass and cant stay in one place.  But were sick of just calling everything energy, because thats misleading.  So well call ALL of this stuff information. Information is the mass, and the energy, and the way its configured, and a whole bunch of stuff about it. \r\n\r\nSo the thing is information is conserved, of course it can change, but the amount of it is always still around.  So you have some fission and that information defines the initial state and the end state and its the same amount of information. \r\n\r\nBut the problem is with black holes.  Black holes as theyre generally thought of essentially break time.  We know when we have fission, that at point A we have so much information, and at point B after theyve undergone fission, we have the same amount of information, but it describes a different system with its resulting products and energy \r\n\r\nBut in black holes its kind of like we have point A, and point B will never exist because time stops working properly in the black hole. \r\n\r\nSo this kind of breaks how we think of the universe.  If we had 100 units of information before, and it falls into a black hole, and we will never have any information again from that, then its not being conserved.  If thats the case, the universe shouldnt have really got started the way we think it did.\r\n\r\nWhat Hawking discovered was that black holes emit radiation.  Radiation is information.  \r\n\r\nWhat happens is first theres nothing.  Then out of nothing you get two things, one is some information, and the other is a debt for that amount of information.  Its kind of like you have some flat ground, and you make a hole.  You dont make any more dirt, youve just made a hole, and another area youve made it a pile.  Now that can just happen anywhere, but the dirt will just fall back into the hole, because youre not actually doing anything, youre not doing any work, youre just saying to the ground This part is the pile, and the empty part around it is the hole  \r\n\r\nBut sometimes what happens is that the black hole incorporates things, sometimes it just gets the hole, and the dirt stays behind.  now it cant just get the dirt and miss the whole for reasons that exceed the analogy  Then the black hole, which is a giant pile, has a bit of itself fall into that little hole that it incorporated.  This continues to happen until the giant pile is flat and the black hole disappears.\r\n\r\nSo that kind of explains the life cycle of a black hole, but theres still a bunch of information that gets into the black hole but doesnt get out.  With the hole and pile explanation here, youre creating new dirt, and destroying a piece of the pile in the black hole, which still has a bit of a problem because things still only really make sense when information doesnt get created and destroyed.  \r\n\r\nSo instead the idea is kind of like all of that information in the black hole sits right on the edge.  When those holes get pulled in, what gets left behind is a bit of that information that went in.  Now its all messed up beyond any recognition, but its the same stuff as went in.  You cant tell what went in by looking at what came out unlike the fat albert analogy but if you knew what went in, and you looked at what came out, you could confirm that what came out was some potential configuration of what went in. \r\n\r\nA better conclusion to the Fat Albert analogy is that Albert eats all of those candies, and you think, Oh dear, those candies have to go somewhere. They cant just stop existing.   But as Fat Albert moves around and you observe him from outside of the range that hes going to eat you, you smell stinky farts, and little piles of poop on the ground.  You know that on some level those gasses and poops were once your beloved candies, but theyre different now. \r\n\r\nEventually Fat Albert dies, and you do a bunch of research and find out that, yes, if you tally up all of the farts, and all of the poops, and all of the decaying matter of Fat Alberts corpse, its possible that the Fat Albert you knew before he became a black hole, plus all of those candies that he ate after he became a black hole could have created the exact same poops, farts and decayed remains as you see here. This just takes a very very long time.\r\n\r\nA turns into B... eventually. \r\n\r\nWithout considering that, we have a situation where Fat Albert slowly turns to nothing, and some new material from nowhere kind of replaces him, which breaks some things about how we understand the universe to work.\r\n\r\nBut it doesnt mean we can look at B and figure out A.  Its just that we can look at B and A, and say, yeah, A could have turned into B. \r\n\r\nIts like how you could squirt a happy face of ketchup on to your macaroni and cheese, and then stir it around.  In the end, you could take a look at that mixed up ketchup and say Yeah, its got the amount of ketchup that I would expect from that happy face that we mixed in.

When you buy something with a debit card, the merchants computer will ask your bank is there enough money in the account to cover this? The banks computer will respond, why, yes! Let me set this portion of money aside for your transaction. This is an authorization. Theyve removed the money from your account, and set it aside for later. \r\n\r\n2. Within a day or so, your bank will collect all the money that it has set aside from all the transactions for the period usually the work day and process i.e. pay at that time. The money is still in your banks hands, you just dont have access to it, because the bank reserved that money for your merchant.\r\n\r\n3. The same works in reverse. If you pay from your bank to your credit card, your bank sets aside the money for the payment, and then actually makes the transfer later. It does this so it can batch make a bunch of transfers at one time.\r\n\r\nThis is ancient technology, as batches arent really necessary any more. There are a few reasons that they still do this\r\n\r\n1. Its embraced inefficiency. Its always been this way. There was a major overhaul about ten years ago concerning checks which is why you can photodeposit now, and that was such a PITA. \r\n\r\n2. It can assist in detecting fraud, criminal activity and mistakes, as the money isnt technically transferred in real time. This is more for transactions in the USA.\r\n\r\n3. Banks can make money on the float. During the temporary period where the money is in the banks possession, but not credited against your credit card, the bank can still earn interest for the day or two delay. Multiply this times thousands of transactions per hour, and you have some significant reasons not to speed things up. Paypal actually has this built into the second business model.\r\n\r\n4. Banks have one of the most powerful lobbies in the USA, and politicians will do what they can to ensure that nothing harms the trade. Banks literally make the economic world go around. If the status quo keeps things operating smoothly, and keep things profitable, and dont fund terror, the politicians will keep them that way. ",0,0,0.5,0,0,0.5,0,0

If a company makes one million dollars, but spends 500,000 on investing in new technology for their product or something like that, theyre only taxed from the remaining 500,000 because thats all of their profit. Im not a businessman so Im not sure on the complete legality of all the kinds of spending but I think this is a basic summary. This is all normal and fine all companies require investing in order to grow their company.\r\n \r\nSo a company in Panama basically made a business in creating fake businesses. Companies could invest million of dollars and then it wouldnt be taxed, because according to legal documents it isnt profit, its an investment, which is untaxable, and then they would get their money back from the fake business. So imagine if that 500,000 of investments from my above example was fake, and after awhile 90 of the money was given back to the business Im assuming the Panamian company took a cut of the money as payment.  2.6 TB of data in total, over 11 million documents and over 200,000 fake companies. According to the website that published the news of the leakhttppanamapapers.sueddeutsche.dearticles56febff0a1bb8d3c3495adf4, they were contacted by an anonymous source with encrypted files with the data sometime in 2015. Heres am exerpt from the article\r\n Over a year ago, an anonymous source contacted the Sddeutsche Zeitung SZ and submitted encrypted internal documents from Mossack Fonseca, a Panamanian law firm that sells anonymous offshore companies around the world. These shell firms enable their owners to cover up their business dealings, no matter how shady.\r\n  \r\nApparently theres several trillion dollars of money that shouldve been taxed and wasnt. Not sure if that means trillions that shouldve been taxed off of, or trillions of dollars of straight tax money, but either way its a LOT.\r\n \r\nMany political leaders many seem to be in the Middle East, and celebrities are involved as well. To prevent any one person from being blamed for the leak, hundreds of news organizations are going to release further full details tonight thats what Ive heard, not sure how true it is but the list apparently has thousands of peoplecompanies on it.

Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didnt pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to increase spending, by reinvesting in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can spend that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake.

He has more knowledge about the industry than nearly anyone in the world, though he retired several years ago.\r\n\r\nHeres what he has to say\r\n\r\nA standard box of oranges as bought from a grower in Florida weighs 90 lbs. That box when extracted by a processor will generate 5.5 to 6.0 gallons of orange juice. A typical box of oranges will supply 180 to 220 oranges ... depending on the maturity and the variety of orange. That means that it takes about 34.8 oranges to produce a gallon of OJ.\r\n\r\nRe cost .... the economics of table fruit that you buy to eat is different than the economics of field run processed fruit. Table run fruit is sorted for appearance, boxed, and sold at a premium. Some varieties of table fruit are also processed but mostly used as table fruit and sell at a significant premium to processed fruit. Valencia, Parson Brown, Pineapple oranges and Hamlins are the main varieties of oranges used in Florida to make OJ in processing plants. Extractor do not grind up the fruit. There are 2 types of extractors .... one reems the fruit like you do at home and the objective of the reem is to get all of the juice, pulp and inside of the orange without impacting the white interior of the fruit albedo which is very bitter. The peels and waste material are then sent to a feed mill where they are pressed to reduce liquid content and dried to make cattle feed. The pressed liquid is run through an evaporator to turn it into molasses and added back to the cattle feed to sweeten it up.\r\n\r\nA comment in the string says dont let them tell you they dont add water because they do. They dont add water to not from  concentrate Orange Juice .... it is against the law and no reputable brand would do this.\r\nThe cost of the oranges is so different because when you buy table fruit it is at most a bag .... processors sign contracts to buy whole groves of oranges .... sometimes buying millions of 90 lb boxes at a time. If you look in the commodity exchange ... you will see Orange Juice Concentrate Futures. This is the price a processor is expecting to pay for a standard pound solid about one gallon of single strength orange juice in the future. That cost typically runs from 1.25 to 2.00 ..... for about 35 processing oranges. See math at the top of this note\r\n\r\nNuf said ...  ",0,0,0.6,0,0,0.4,0,0

All that is true, but it doesnt explain how OJ is economically viable. \r\n\r\nIf one orange tree can produce X bottles of juice, and maintaining the tree  harvesting  land  all the other costs ends up being Y dollars per tree, then all you have to do is do a little math to figure out how much you can sell bottles for and come out ahead.\r\n\r\nI think what youre really asking is how can orange juice be so cheap compared to the cost of the oranges it would take you to produce the same amount. Here you have to remember that orange growers arent charging for oranges based on their expenses but based on how much youll pay for them. If youll pay 50 cents for an orange then they charge that. You might not want to pay a dollar. Theyre going to sell an amount of oranges that maximizes value. Better 1,000 oranges at 50 cents than 200 oranges at a dollar.\r\n\r\nIf we assume that selling oranges in their natural form is the most profitable way for growers to sell them, then they would sell all of them this way if possible. If they flood the market with oranges though the price will go down. At a certain point it would become costprohibitive. If oranges were selling for a penny a piece then everyone would go out of business probably. So if orange growers only sell 10 of their oranges this way before it becomes inefficient, they can use the other 90 to make juice.\r\n\r\nMaking juice might only yield a profit of 1 penny per orange, while selling oranges straight up yields a nickel per orange. But its better to make that 1 penny than flood the market with oranges and go out of business. \r\n\r\nTLDR its all about meeting demand at efficient levels for each portion of the market.
